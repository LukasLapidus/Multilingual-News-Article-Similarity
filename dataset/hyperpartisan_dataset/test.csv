Intelligence sources tell NBC News that in the year before the U.S. raid that killed Osama bin Laden, a retired Pakistani military intelligence officer helped the CIA track him down. The original version of this story said that a Pakistani asset told the U.S. where bin Laden was hiding. The U.S. government has always characterized the heroic raid by Seal Team Six that killed bin Laden as a unilateral U.S. operation, and has maintained that the CIA found him by tracking the courier. ""The notion that the operation that killed Osama Bin Laden was anything but a unilateral U.S. mission is patently false,"" said NSC spokesman Ned Price. Said one former senior official, ""We were suspicious that someone inside ISI knew where bin Laden was, but we did not have intelligence about specific individuals having specific knowledge."" Multiple U.S. officials, however, denied or cast doubt on the assertion that the U.S. told the Pakistanis about the bin Laden raid ahead of time.

The chess board is now set for the civil trial against the Albuquerque Police Department and one its detectives, Brett Lampiris-Tremba, who fatally shot Iraq War veteran Kenneth Ellis III outside a city convenience store in January 2010. That means the jury will decide how much money the city owes Ellis family, rather than whether the shooting was lawful.

Lets take yet again-what else?-the case of Antigone, Zizek writes, acknowledging how much time hes spent laboring over this case. Its disappointing that he doesnt see the potential in that group, preferring instead to offer up odds on whether it will be Lenin or Jesus that returns first, seeing as how in his mythology they represent more or less the same thing. As such, it not only reads like an angry letter to the editor-which is what it should have been-but the information it conveys is both obfuscatory and redundant: the former because it is a jargon-heavy dredge through digressive minutiae; the latter because hes merely showing us another proof of his theoretical formula in action. So hes maybe the most succinct and astute exponent not just of Lacanian and Marxist thought, but of the notion that those two modes of thought can still lay claim to some relevance in contemporary cultural politics and analysis. Given that Zizek is also the primary exponent of the radical core of the Christian legacy, (see his The Fragile Absolute) one might be rightly concerned that this is just what he has in mind. I know Zizek hates self-described Third Way socialists, but condom sex-flawed as it may be-is a much better deal than either celibacy or pregnancy/AIDS/etc. Given all of this, I hope Zizek wont be offended if I take up sides with the pragmatic incarnation of Critical Mass.

No doubt infected by the corrosive wave of cynical anti-Americanism now raging across an ungrateful world, we predicted that the report of David Kaywho was hired by the CIA to find Iraqs elusive weapons of mass destructionwould be nothing but a sham, a whitewash: the fix is in, we sneered. The entire case for war, put forth so meticulously by the Bushists in national forums and at the UN, was based on lies, bribes, distortionsand threadbare intelligence cooked to order for the conspirators in the White House, who set up a system that deliberately ignored or rejected any finding that clashed with their unalterable plans for aggression and conquest, as Seymour Hersh reports in the New Yorker. In damning detail, Kay has revealed the torturous machinations and evil practices of a ruthless tyrant seeking to thwart the clear will of the UN Security Council and the international community, using false declarations and crude propaganda to mask his secret plans to abet terrorism, wage aggressive war and threaten the entire world with weapons of mass destruction.

But breaking their stranglehold on our health system and our politicians is the only way for health reform to get beyond square one. According to the states figures, almost half of the previously uninsured gained coverage under the health reform bill by July 1. Hospitals like Massachusetts General are reporting record profits and enjoying rate increases tucked into the reform package. Meanwhile, new rules for the free care pool will drastically cut funding for the hundreds of thousands who remain uninsured, and for the safety-net hospitals and clinics that care for them. Single payer reform could save $7.7 billion annually on paperwork and insurance profits in Massachusetts, enough to cover all of the uninsured and to upgrade coverage for the rest of us. The Connectorthe new state agency created to broker coverage under the reform lawis adding another 4.5 percent to the already sky-high overhead charged by private insurers. But according to the Census Bureau, the new sign-ups amount to less than one-quarter of the uninsured. Health reform built on private insurance isnt working and cant work; it costs too much and delivers too little. Illness will still bring crippling medical billsbut the $8,638 annual premium will empty their bank accounts even before the bills start arriving.

As part of Precision's statements following its press release, it said that demand was increasing enough that it could start commanding higher day rates for its rigs. Also, in the beginning of February, Nabors announced it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Weatherford International for the two companies to collaborate on providing a more full-service drilling offering to producers by combining some of Nabors' fleet with some of Weatherford's well design, engineering, and pressure-pumping services.

Advertisement Schools may enter into agreements with banks, including Wells Fargo or U.S. Bank, or non-bank financial firms, including Higher One, which is the largest firm offering financial-aid-disbursement services on campuses. Continue Reading Below The last thing students with financial aid need is to be charged hefty fees just to access the money they are counting on to cover their expenses. Banking agreements between schools and financial firms may result in arrangements that expose students to aggressive marketing tactics, high or unusual fees, and restricted choices for managing their money. The Government Accountability Office has found that some schools fail to present financial-aid disbursement options in a clear and neutral manner, and appeared to encourage students to select school-sponsored accounts. While these products can be convenient for students and cost effective for colleges and universities, certain campus banking products have come under scrutiny for their controversial fees and policies. But thats exactly what many face when financial aid is disbursed on campus banking products, which have become increasingly common at schools across the country. Too often, these fees are not clearly disclosed, and the schools, which sometimes have a financial stake in co-branded banking cards, may not always negotiate the best deal for students. Those fees can add up if students use their cards frequently and dont have access to in-network ATMs, according to a new Consumer Reports investigation (PDF). Students deserve safe and convenient access to their financial aid funds without unnecessary and costly charges. In addition to high out-of-network ATM charges, students can be charged fees for making PIN debit purchases, or even inactivity fees when they dont use their cards frequently enough. This fall, an estimated 21 million students are attending colleges and universities in the U.S. From the 2007 to 2012 academic years, the percentage of first-time, full-time undergrads at four-year colleges who received financial aid shot up from 75 to 85%.

The following day De Gaulle ran up to me, insisting that I read a message received on his hand computer. De Gaulle lived with these questionsignored by officialdom and even by the remaining members of his own familythroughout the rest of his youth and young adulthood.

But to be eligible for the scholarships, state law requires students to complete their senior year in New Mexico. Further vexing was the fact that the family was told the sisters would not be eligible for in-state tuition.

Defense in Colorado theater shooting trial rests its case..................................................................................................................................................................................... Holmes' public defenders ended their case after playing two silent surveillance videos of Holmes taken in the months following the attack. ADVERTISEMENT The decision to rest the case ended 10 weeks of often-gruesome testimony, with witnesses describing the bloody shooting scene and their own crippling wounds and attorneys probing psychiatrists about Holmes' mental condition. He says it's unlikely the jury will find Holmes not guilty by reason of insanity but that the evidence of mental illness might persuade jurors to spare his life. Gur, head of neuropsychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania medical school, said Holmes still suffers from the bizarre delusions that preoccupied him before the shooting, including his belief that killing others would increase his own self-worth. Public defenders presented two weeks of testimony that featured a pair of psychiatrists who found that Holmes met the legal standard for insanity. That's also when the judge will reveal the 12 jurors who will deliberate the case and seven alternates who will report to the courthouse but have no contact with the others.

In the meantime, Manchin will likely appoint someone to keep the seat warm for him who is largely in line with his views (hes already said he wont appoint himself, but has made it clear that he has national ambitions).

Also, the comment by the spokeswoman that they couldnt have known because thats not what Marines are about seems hard to believe, as does the revelation that this is NOT an isolated incident.

Whose National Security are We Talking About?.During three hours of conversation several weeks before 9/11 with a key Washington insider familiar with the national security establishment, I learned that one of the founding fathers of U.S. National Security sexually molested his own children. We find ourselves in a very bad pattern, and if fundamental and far-reaching corrections are not made soon, my guess is that the next few years will hold more Watergates, Irangates, and other gates, as it will become clear and indisputable that we cannot sustain a healthy democracy with its representative, nosy institutions while at the same time fostering the imperial military system which has intruded itself into the lives of our neighbors and exceeded all bounds of honor and decency. But the meeting convinced me that it was clearly time to examine the mindset of secrecy, lying and spying set in motion by this pedophile and his cronies in 1947 with the creation of the National Security Act. In 1955, the Hoover Commissions special task force, headed by Gen. Mark Clark, stated its concern over the absence of satisfactory machinery for surveillance of the stewardship of CIA * * * President Truman, in a Washington Post article in 1963 wrote: For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been directed from its original assignment.

A bill that would give workers for Illinois Cook County, which includes Chicago, one hour of paid sick time for each 40 hours they work passed on a vote Wednesday. The company gives workers unlimited vacation and sick leave they take as many days as they need and the company keeps track of what category each one falls into. ADVERTISEMENT The move toward paid sick leave has accelerated in the past three years as 30 states, counties and cities approved laws, according to Bravos group. President Barack Obama signed an executive order requiring companies with contracts or subcontracts with the federal government to give workers up to seven paid sick days each year. Most companies do give their employees paid time off when theyre sick. Some small-business advocacy groups say mandatory paid sick leave can drive up companies expenses for example, if they have to hire replacement workers. But theres no federal law mandating that all companies give staffers paid leave and those businesses that dont tend to be very small, often with blue-collar workers.

(Photo public domain) A federal judge in Maryland has issued a ruling against President Trumps ban on transgender people serving in the U.S. military, the second court decision against the policy. Like the earlier court decision, Garbis cites Trumps decision to announce the transgender military ban in July via Twitter as evidence it was driven by animus, and not a well thought-out military decision. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesperson, said the Trump administration will continue to defend the transgender military ban in court. The lawsuit one of four pending challenges to the transgender military ban was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Maryland and Covington amp; Burling LLP on behalf of six transgender service members fearing discharge under Trumps policy. Garbis rendered the decision on the basis that the policy against transgender people should be viewed in the courts with heightened scrutiny, but also determined the military ban would fail under the less rigorous review of the rational basis standard. Last month, a federal court in D.C. blocked Trump from enforcing the policy, although left standing a provision denying gender reassignment surgery for transgender service members. Lauren Ehrsam, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the Trump administration disagrees with the decision by the court.

Of course, there are still people on the left who are absolutely sure about their political position and zealous in its defense. What we face in Washington is an ideologically driven politics, in which class interest is certainly well represented but also exaggerated and distorted. In fact, ideology rules everywhere on the right, across the spectrum of issues in which right-wing intellectuals and activists take an interest (note the combination: it used to be only the left that had intellectuals and activists). If the old Marxist ruling class were actually ruling right now, its policies would be considerably more moderate than those of this administration-at home and, even more clearly, abroad. We defend policies like Social Security, which have worked pretty well, and try to make them work a little better. But maybe frightened people look for strong leaders, whose strength is revealed in their firm commitment to a set of values. Everywhere, we see radically coherent, single-causal analyses of social problems and radical proposals to deal with the problems once and for all: lower and lower taxes, privatized Social Security, tests and more tests in the public schools, torture for terrorists, war for Saddam, democracy for the Arabs.

Therefore, Xilinx's advanced products revenue should keep increasing thanks to the secular growth of ADAS chips and the company's strong customer relationships in this space. Throw in strong quarterly guidance that calls for $630 million in revenue at the midpoint as compared to Wall Street's $626 million#160;expectation and it isn't surprising to see why Xilinx stock has continued its upward trajectory after the quarterly report was released on Oct. 25.

In short, investors appear to be betting that Juno might be the next buyout target by either Gilead or perhaps its main CAR-T development partner,#160;Celgene Corporation. So, if you're looking for a CAR-T stock in the wake of Gilead's high-dollar acquisition of Kite, Juno may be worth checking out because of its ginormous financial advantage over the remaining field of clinical-stage companies. The key takeaway is that Juno shouldn't need to execute any additional value-destroying secondary offers as its broad pipeline makes strides toward a possible regulatory filing next year. Turning to the specifics, Juno now sports over $1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities after a recent $318.7 million capital raise (before deducting fees) -- which is easy enough to see JCAR017 through to a regulatory filing and perhaps a commercial launch as well. Juno, as a leading CAR-T developer, has clearly been benefiting from this surge in interest from investors, with its shares gaining a healthy 60% in just the past two months. So, Juno arguably isn't nearly as attractive of a buyout candidate as Kite at this stage in the game -- implying that investors should probably temper their expectations regarding a possible buyout scenario for the",1,3

Cruise missiles, used by Bill Clinton as a way of expressing his displeasure at Sudan, may be useful for destroying pharmaceutical factories, hospitals, even defense ministries, but the body counts are not robust. But Bush and advisers seem to be embarking on a course of folly that will not strike down, may even bolster the Taleban, and that could indeed lead to a coup in Pakistan, installing in power army officers deeply complicit with the Taleban and also in possession of nuclear weapons. The mere mounting an expeditionary force would take would be a difficult, possibly protracted business, landing the United States in a prodigious number of diplomatic difficulties, given the mutual antagonisms and stresses of adjacent or nearby states such as Pakistan, India, Russias dependency Tadzikistan, China.

Founded in 2010 with help from Bush guru Karl Rove, the Crossroads groups are now trumpeting a new fundraising target to double their planned haul of $120 million for the 2012 elections. To help them reach their eye-popping fundraising goal, the Crossroads groups have tapped one of the most successful GOP fundraisers of them all, Mississippi Gov.

Yes, you read that right: the Crossroads groups say they will raise a whopping $240 million to vanquish President Obama, help GOPers win the Senate majority, and strengthen their House majority. Both Governor Barbour and Karl Rove are prodigious fundraisers and brilliant strategists, and we are honored to have them both engaged with us, Steven Law, president of both American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, said in a statement.

3594,"Perhaps most remarkable was the way Trump glossed over recent GOP policies in the Middle East, which many analysts say bear some blame for the regional mayhem Trump described, including the rise of ISIL. New York Times reporter Mark Landler recounts in his recently released book Alter Egos: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the Twilight Struggle Over American Power that on nearly every major foreign-policy decision that Clinton weighed in on during her time as the nations chief diplomat, she found herself to the right of the Pentagon. Sanders, of course, has now endorsed Clinton, and he spent Thursday night sharply criticizing many of the statements Trump made during his acceptance speech. However, those hopes were not fulfilled, writes Michael Crowley at Politico: Trumps words underscored a sudden and dramatic shift in direction for a Republican Party once proudly associated with military intervention and democracy promotion in the Arab world. Crowley continues: Like many other Republican speakers this week, Trump also blamed [Hillary] Clinton for the Islamist assault on a U.S. compound in Benghazi that left four Americans dead. Even The New York Times, which has faced criticism for its lack of objectivity in covering Clinton, published a lengthy adapted excerpt from Landlers book outlining how she has displayed instincts on foreign policy that are more aggressive than those of President Obama and most Democrats throughout her career. Critics, including members of Hillary Clintons campaign, noted that this proposition would undoubtedly thrill Vladimir Putin its no secret that he and Trump have expressed admiration for each other. America is far less safeand the world is far less stable than when Obama made the decision to put Hillary Clinton in charge of Americas foreign policy, Trump said. Many longtime Republican politicians, like Sen. Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, hoped Trump would clarify his remarks during his nomination acceptance speech.

11976,"Hochschild believes that Sanders knows there are issues that apply specifically to minorities and that they need to be addressed directly, but he may also be thinking that the core issue influencing the more specific issues is the problem of people not having enough money to live, being pushed out of the system that they live in and thus not having a voice in society. Though Sanders does tend to zoom in on income inequality, which he has said is specifically important for minority communities, his record reflects a long history of fighting for civil rights and related reforms. ""From Ferguson to Baltimore and across this nation, too many African-Americans and other minorities find themselves subjected to a system that treats citizens who have not committed crimes as if they were criminals, and that is unacceptable,"" Sanders said in June, echoing comments he made last year. Whether his outreach efforts will suffice remains to be seen, but it is clear after the Netroots Nation conference that some minority voters question his dedication to racial issues and believe he is most closely focused upon income inequality. Sanders frequently talks about how he wants a ""political revolution,"" and it's possible he envisions changing how the government works as a way to lift minorities and the very poor from a position of not having influence. This may reflect that Sanders thinks that the most important way to help both minority and white communities is to ensure that everyone gets a fair chance at making it. When it comes to the minority vote, much of the problem for Sanders is simply the fact many minority voters do not know who he is. Many may want Sanders to directly draw the link between structural and institutional problems and how they create issues such as police violence. And it has become clear that many voters want to hear about direct action concerning surface issues. ""When you see the kind of force that's been used in Ferguson, it really does make it appear that the police department there is an occupying army in a hostile territory and that is absolutely not what we want to see in the U.S.,"" Sanders said last August.

It is a charming love story which ends with a boldnot to say foolhardyreprise of the love-and-firearms motif which helps to obscure the lack of any real transition from Angle the love-shy to Angle the (presumably) loving. It can hardly be surprising that any woman in this situation, let alone one with Angles history, would take a rather jaundiced view of the relations between the sexes. Like the heroine of the Spanish Solas, Angle shows us the desolation that lies just beneath the surface of so much self-consciously pursued pleasure something that would scarcely be allowed in the Hollywood version.

Naturally, Angle is suspicious, but it soon becomes clear that the real danger, from her point of view, is not that Antoine is insincere but rather that, as she very much fears, he really means it. Nevertheless, we know that she has been close to a man called Jacques (Jacques Bonnaff)and that there seems to have been, rather incredibly, some gunplay involved in that relationship too which resulted in Jacquess facial disfigurement.

Only this next time, the rest of US will be even less prepared and able to enduregiven the decade of stagnant wages, new record in household debt, collapsing savings rates, greater reliance on part time/temp/gig employment, decline of pensions, loss of social benefits and safety net, higher cost of healthcare, and all the rest of the economic decline that is afflicting more than 100 million households in the US today. And will the Fed and US government then legitimize and legalize the private banks taking the savings of average depositors and converting those savings to worthless bank stocks?

What made him the bold leader he eventually became as Pope John#160;XXIII#160;were his lifelong study of history which taught him that the Church must adapt its presentation of perennial truths to the demands of a given cultural moment, so that the truth can be heard and engaged and his life outside what I would call the Catholic bubble. WEIGEL: Both men understood that, at the root of the sorrows of the 20th century, there was a profound anthropological crisis a crisis in the very idea of the human person.#160;Roncalli#160;understood this experientially and historically, and responded to it in a deeply personal way that exuded pastoral charity.#160;Wojtyla#160;got it experientially, analyzed it philosophically, and put the Christian view of the inalienable dignity of the human person at the center of his teaching and witness. WEIGEL: If by this you mean the canonization doubleheader, its the best kind of reset: a reminder that the Church is, at the bottom of the bottom line, in the business of facilitating holiness, which comes through friendship with Jesus Christ. Second, its clear that the Holy See and the pope were not living the abuse crisis in real time with the Church in the United States in 2002, an information#160;lag that led to a misimpression of inattention or refusal to face facts.

Bob Schieffer, CBS newsman, who calls himself a fledgling songwriter, hosted this year's ceremonies in Falls Church This is indeed a great honor to be recognized by our fellow musicians, says Doris Au MacDonald, keyboardist of The Braeded Chord. This marks the second year in a row that the performing songwriting duo, consisting of Sharon Dennis, a Culpeper guitarist, and Doris Au MacDonald of Fairfax, who plays keyboard, has been nominated for a WAMMIE honor by its music peers. They won, not only for what they do, but how they do it, remarked Ron Goad, long-time Songwriters Association of Washington board member, who is himself a fixture on the local music scene. Traditionally held to a standing room only crowd in the State Theater in Falls Church, the ceremony represents the coming together of many different musical styles and is an indicatin of the greater Washington community's support of its local musicians. They have been the featured musicians at the last two Baptist Women's Getaway Weekends at Eagle Eyrie Baptist Conference Center. They serve as the worship leaders for Church of the Word in Gainesville and perform in local coffeehouses, churches, festivals and benefits, as well as touring out of state. They also hold worship workshops and consult with churches interested in incorporating a multi-genre, multi-generational style of worship in their services. The WAMMIES began 21 years ago, with the first awards going to such notables as Emmylou Harris, Chuck Brown, Marvin Gaye, Patsy Cline and Duke Ellington. We were surrounded by all of these great musicians, and we couldn't believe it when they called our names!

Freebies May Be the Key to Safe Gun Storage Programs.Public health researchers already know that the safe storage of guns can significantly reduce self-inflicted and unintentional firearm injuries in the home. Six of the studies used safe storage programs that incorporated counseling on the risks of having unsecured guns in the home, and two of those also provided firearms owners with a free gun lock. Most of the studies in Rowhani-Rahbars review provided counseling in a clinical setting at pediatric practices, for example but that doesnt address whether the information is better delivered by doctors or distributed via#160;educational materials, public service announcements, or gun stores. One program studied provided whole gun cabinets to participants in rural Alaska, but no counseling only instructions to lock household firearms in the cabinet and keep its key in a secure location. Some states, like California, have passed laws to fill that void, and require that all guns sold and transferred be locked.#160;The issue becomes more contentious #160;and politicized when legislators turn their attention to how guns are stored in the home: States like#160; Massachusetts have passed laws that criminalize the storage of unlocked firearms, but many pro-gun advocates#160; argue that such requirements hinder their ability to use firearms in self-defense. Whats been less clear is whether programs that promote storing firearms locked, unloaded, and separate from ammunition actually convince gun owners to do so. Before we did this review, we didnt know which interventions would prove to be the most effective, Ali Rowhani-Rahbar, the studys lead author, tells The Trace.But the totality of the findings indicate that giving individuals these devices, augmented by counseling, may be a fruitful, effective strategy to promote safe firearm storage.

Censorship in China is nothing new and the revelations that members of China's top leadership operate offshore shell corporations isnt that surprising, according to Sarah Cook,#160;director of the China Media Bulletin at Freedom House. Cook says the Panama Papers confirm the suspicions many people in China already have. In fact, Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, did report on the resignation of Iceland's prime minister, but failed to mention anything about the reason he resigned.#160;But Cook says the bigger censorship battle is not with the Chinese press, but in the social media sphere. According to Cook, that doesnt sit well with ordinary people who are working day in and day out to try to earn some money, or the lower echelons of the Communist Party many of whom have been hit very hard by President Xis anti-corruption campaign.

5651,"Aside from inspiring some of those literary figures that got Candace Slater interested in cordels in the first place, they also have always had a close relationship with Brazilian music. And, of course, the story of Brazil's rise to economic superpower is sure to be told, retold, and commented on in cordel verses for years to come. Candace Slater thinks it makes sense that the world conjured in cordel still captures Brazil's imagination. Why Brazil Loves the Cordel.While soap opera fans in America lament the loss of ""All My Children,"" telenovela fans in Brazil are also saying goodbye to a belovedalthough much shorter livedTV drama called ""Cordel Encantado."" She started researching cordels in the 1970s because she knew they had inspired so many of Brazil's major literary figures. She says that, as Brazil races forward as a major world power, cordel's picture of northeastern culture is appealing. ""It's a kind of culture that on one hand people are really happy is gone, in the sense of it was very unjust, it was very poor, it was deeply troubling in the sense of inequalities,"" Slater says. One popular one goes, roughly, like this: Once upon a time, a young man fell helplessly in love with a very lovely young woman. ""But, it's not surprising that at a time of great change, and a certain anxiety about what will Brazil be as a world economic power, the whole idea of this magical kingdom in the far off backlands, where things supposedly haven't changed, is a lot more intriguing."" Many cordel writers are also singers and songwriters, and many classic Brazilian songs draw on cordel stories. In one scene from the show's final episode, crowds at a sumptuously lit open-air market gather around a circle of cordel poets, our friend Gonalo Ferreira da Silva among them. Cordel, Slater says, provides order and explanations for some of life's more gruesome realities.",0,2

When you have a sheriff for 24 years who did everything to build divisions between the community and the sheriffs office, it will take a lot of time and money to rebuild those relationships, Gallardo said. To me, all the harm that he caused, not just to me but to many families, the separation of families, thats something thats never going to be repaired whether he gets jail time or not. Immigrants who were illegally detained when Arpaio kept up his patrols will be able to seek money from the county government as compensation for harm they suffered. The financial hemorrhaging is expected to persist until the sheriffs office fully complies with court-ordered changes for three straight years. Jack Wilenchik, one of his lawyers, would not reveal how Arpaio was handling the verdict but emphasized that his clients fate should have been decided by a jury, not a judge. Arpaios successor, Sheriff Paul Penzone, through a spokesman, declined a request from The Associated Press to comment on whether the verdict will help turn the page on Arpaios 24-year tenure. The verdict marked a final rebuke for a politician who once drew strong support from immigration crackdowns but was booted from office last year as voters got frustrated with his headline-grabbing tactics, such as jailing inmates in tents during triple-degree summer heat and making them wear pink underwear. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Arpaio guilty of misdemeanor contempt of court Monday for intentionally defying a 2011 court order to stop traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.

Rintoul and his colleagues, on board the government vessel Aurora Australis, were able to navigate extremely close to the Totten ice shelf edge in January of 2015, when an opening in the sea ice allowed the ship to get in closer than one ever has before. The measurements, sampling ocean temperatures in seas over a kilometer (0.62 miles) deep in some places right at the edge of Totten glaciers floating ice shelf, affirmed that warm ocean water is flowing in towards the glacier at the rate of 220,000 cubic meters per second. In the case of Totten glacier, its so-called grounding line, which is where the glacier begins to lift off the seafloor and to float, forming an ice shelf with an ocean cavity beneath it, is nearly a mile and a half deep. The researchers took ocean measurements at 10 separate points along the floating Totten ice shelf. If all of this ice were to end up in the ocean somehow, seas would raise by about 11.5 feet.

She said Kahlo always recognized the power of photography, in part because her father was a professional photographer. Mexico was just emerging from the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz, where they were trying to prove their modernism by being as much like Europe and North America as possible, and then came this counter-movement of pride in Mexican-ness, which went back to the pre-Hispanic cultures and to the ethnic cultures, which is still very much alive in Mexico today. Documenting cultures is a real passion of mine, said Frej, who retired after 30 years as a diplomat with the Agency for International Development always with my camera at my side. The light that day was extraordinary, the blue from the exterior was reflected back into that studio, and you really got a good sense of what I think was a real stimulus for her and her work, and that was that extraordinary environment. The black-and-white photos reveal a timeline of Kahlos chaotic, pain-filled life from her birth in 1907 to her death in 1954, as both an artist and one of the most photographed women of her generation. ADVERTISEMENT The Santa Fe show coalesced after Spencer Throckmorton, owner of Throckmorton Fine Arts in New York City, offered to loan his extensive collection of vintage Kahlo photographs.

He might have simply responded to folks like Seth Rogan, who criticized his poor choice of costume attire, saying simply that it was a poor choice and that hes essentially a moron for not realize the stereotypes that his costume would invoked, particularly to people who have been targeted with those stereotypes by hate groups, and even regimes, over the past century. Perhaps, though, perhaps he thought to himself, Ill dress up like a smarmy 1970s record executive, as I envision him, and did not realize the anti-Jewish imagery that had been so deeply embedded into his subconscious.

Why he waited so long for a simple apology is anyones guess, but now that he has offered it, we can only accept it, and surmise that Macklemore was just that woefully ignorant of modern history and social issues extending beyond those that are currently in vogue for him to potentially market himself with to a young generation (as important as they are). Perhaps, looking like an anti-Jewish stereotype was just that deeply embedded in his mind as what someone should look like if they wished to look truly ridiculous. Because of the targeting of members of the Jewish religious community by the Third Reich, coming to a head in what was by all standards of history one of the most institutionalized act of genocide we have record of, it is a bit more difficult to find costumes marketed specifically as mocking Jews.

As the piecemeal push to alleviate the effects of e-waste becomes more cohesive, Smith and the International Campaign for Responsible Technology are homing in on a handful of specific objectives that could usher in a future of sustainable electronics. As massive semiconductor and consumer electronics manufacturers sprang up and churned out cutting-edge products, Smith rounded up community members to take a stand against the industrys lack of transparency about the chemicals used along the production line and the threats these substances posed to workers, the environment, and nearby residents. One persistent barrier in the United States, however, is the lack of federal legislation to make sure e-waste is properly recycled. While Smith sees promise in Fairphones approach and the sustainable electronics movement, major manufacturers living under the dictate of the quarterly profit remain the largest obstacle. The Fairphone is one of the most palpable examples of benign-by-design, a school of thought that aims to make products less harmful throughout their entire life cycle. One of their biggest ambitions is to see a requirement that companies disclose all of the chemicals used in a products lifecycle. He sees the face of the factory worker who lives on a corporate campus in China and works long shifts, exposed to hazardous chemicals while assembling miniscule components. A study published in the Journal of Environmental Health Perspectives found that children living in Guiyu had significantly higher levels of lead in their blood than children from Chendian, a nearby city with no e-waste processing. Compare that with the European Union, which last year imposed a strict directive requiring that by 2019 member countries collect 65 percent of the weight of all electronics put on sale in the preceding three years or 85 percent of all e-waste generated per year.

5242,"Catania and his team discovered that once the eel spots its prey, it releases electrical pulses that seem to immobilize the fish or make it jump up to indicate where it is hiding. Electric eels reach into prey’s brains using electric discharges.Electric eels have an ability to remotely control their prey, according to a new study. One researcher from Vanderbilt University in Nashbille, Tennessee, discovered that electrical dishcarges from the eel cause the muscles of the prey to twitch. When observing the eels, Catania also noticed the eels unique hunting strategy, which involves giving off pairs of pulses once the possible prey was out of view. The study, reported in the journal Science, indicates that eels use high voltage discharges to control and ultimately capture their prey as opposed to simply stunning it. According to National Geographic, electric eels can generate an electrical charge of up to 600 volts in order to stun prey and keep predators at bay. The sea creature uses its#160;electric organs to control prey, researchers say. He observes that this behavior is most commonly noticed when the eel is excited, sensing that food is near, but cannot yet find it. Dr. Catania said in a statement, When the eels pulses slow down when the eel gets tired at the end of its attack you see individual fish twitches, with one twitch from every pulse. Study leader Kenneth Catania placed an eel and a fish into the same tank to verify the results. It was later discovered that these electrical pulses play a direct role in activating nerves that control the preys muscles. This behavior generates very strong and fast muscle contraction.",0,2

14735,"As leader of the Justice and Development Party, or AKP, he has courted Kurdish votes by offering greater rights - and even by making peace, for a time, with the extremist group known as the Kurdistan Workers? This embrace of pluralism in Turkish life may be as important as the rejection of Erdogan's executive-power grab. Erdogan himself, ironically, helped encourage the Kurdish activism that was a potent factor in Sunday's elections. Erdogan failed to get his mandate because he challenged a culture of checks and balances, and the institutions that give Turkish democracy its resilience. Fareed Zakaria has written over the past decade about the rise of what he calls ""illiberal democracy"" - the growing power of leaders like Erdogan, Xi and Putin who govern with a veneer of popular legitimacy but a core of state control. It won more than 13 percent to become the first explicitly Kurdish-oriented parliamentary party in Turkey's history. The Turkish election has global importance because it challenges what had seemed, until recently, the inexorable rise of nationalist strongmen and authoritarian parties. These were the very parts of Turkish society that Erdogan was seen as trying to intimidate or repress in his bid for greater power. Proponents of the so-called Beijing Consensus argued that the great advantage of the Chinese model was that it worked; centralized state power could achieve results that were impossible in more chaotic, bottom-up democracies. Why did Turkish voters reject authoritarianism at a time when its appeal still seems strong in other places? But on Sunday, the vehicle for Kurdish self-expression turned out to be the liberal People's Democratic Party, or HDP, headed by the charismatic Selahattin Demirtas. This idea of the efficient despot got a sharp rebuff Sunday in Turkey's parliamentary elections.",0,0

Even without psychological theories of narcissism, the whole idea of ecstatic Christian masses spotting a halo around Bushs head in Newsweek seems a little nuts at face value, though it must make Karl Rove pee his pants with glee in that campaign headquarters known as the White House. For example, if an ordinary citizen believed he was being directed by God to attack the governments where the Bible happened, as he once described the Middle East, or thought that ordering the execution of a criminal was funny as hell, or saw everyone who disagreed with him as an agent of the Devil, he or she would be put on some heavy meds at the very least.

According to Malcolm Turnbull, The overhaul will make it easier for Defence to work together with federal, state and territory police in the event of a terrorist incident. Civilian functions more akin to traditional policing and processing have become the purview of the military, a move that was significantly advanced during the years of the Howard government. In the past, Australias military has become the fall-back option for authorities, called upon as a grand clearing house to supply substitute civilian functions. Australias Turnbull government has promised new powers under a national security review conducted last year that will grant the Australian army powers to kill terrors suspects on sight. The Prime Minister, showing he is far from mellowing in his role on the subject of defusing fear, insists on the authoritarian prerogative of streamlining and trimming the interaction between military and policing functions. There is, for instance, no equivalent Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 US initiative passed by a Democratic-led Congress after troops were deployed two years prior ostensibly to maintain order at various polling places in southern states. State and territory police forces remain the best first response to terrorist incidents immediately after an attack starts. The NFFs request was perhaps understandable, given that a Labor prime minister, Bob Hawke, had used military personnel and material to replace lost manpower during the famed wage dispute of Australian pilots in 1989. Unfortunately, such moves tend to take place long after the horse has bolted, an ineffectual measure in terms of combating terrorism but pernicious in terms of dealing with distinctions policing.

3455,"Toronto Film Review: ‘Mary Goes Round’.A prodigal daughter returns in Mary Goes Round, discovering that the personal problems shes been studiously ignoring only grow more inescapable in the presence of the estranged family members who more or less caused them. In fact, Walts real agenda is something quite different than his setup: Hes dying of cancer, hasnt told Robyn and wants Mary to perform that unpleasant duty while hopefully forging a sisterly bond for the future. While her demons arent quite ready to be dried out yet amid this stress, our heroine is now self-aware enough to acquire an unofficial local AA sponsor in the form of Lou (a fine turn by Melanie Nicholls-King). Upon turning up in Niagara Falls, however, Mary discovers not only that surly Robyn is displeased to see her, she claims not to have even known she had#160;a half-sister. Its cold comfort that Walt (John Ralston) has since sobered up, becoming a much-improved parent to his second daughter by a second wife, also deceased. Working as a professional substance-abuse counselor gives Mary additional incentive to deny shes in exactly the same boat as her clients. Naturally, this is crap news all around, with Mary, the badly treated offspring, being asked to do all the heavy lifting for a sibling who got the (comparatively) good parenting. The script by McGlynn (whose own immediate-family history is roughly akin to Marys) is understated and astute, with characters that never feel like types despite our having seen their ilk onscreen before. Mary ( Aya Cash) is a 29-year-old Toronto resident with a serious partying jones. Molly McGlynns somewhat autobiographically inspired debut feature bears a certain resemblance to James Ponsoldts 2012 Smashed, with a similar young, middle-class alcoholic as heroine. He claims Marys teenaged half-sister Robyn (Sara Waisglass) has been clamoring to meet her. Its as opportune a moment as any to finally answer many",0,4
1206,"But there are things that we do agree on, and there are boundaries that, when crossed, we believe pro-Israel American Jews must speak out against as a united front. I believe that Israel, the only Jewish state in the world, is targeted disproportionately in international institutions like the United Nations. I believe that among the most important obstacles to peace are factors that Israel can control, like settlement expansion and governmental appeasement of the far-right wing of Israels political spectrum. I believe that Israel is a legitimate partner for peace, and that the Palestinian leadership has direly failed its people. ADVERTISEMENT Friedmans views, close ties to the settlement movement and propensity for outrageous personal attacks make clear that he is completely unsuitable to serve as American ambassador to Israel. Indeed, the inability to recognize the humanity of ones neighbor that Friedman has displayed is part of the reason that Israelis and Palestinians alike still feel the effects of the ongoing conflict on a daily basis. Moreover, he has articulated support for annexation of the West Bank, which we recognize to be a policy that would permanently debilitate aspirations for a Palestinian and a Jewish state to live side by side. I believe that the current Israeli government has shown little to no evidence of working toward a sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We cannot stand idly by as members of J Street are called worse than Kapos (a disgraceful reference to Jews who aided Nazis during the Holocaust) and described as not Jewish simply because of political disagreements.

He testified that the district attorney at the time knew Feit killed Irene Garza and that the church knew it, but promised to move him to a monastery if he was not prosecuted. Garza said that a month before the victim went missing, a female college student reported that a man attacked her from behind in church and tried to suffocate her.

6044,"(Adophe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) Special Agent in Charge Anthony Maez, who heads the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Unit and the New Mexico Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, estimates that one out of three people arrested on child porn charges has either sexually abused a child or is thinking about it. Following trails of computer footprints left by child porn traffickers, law enforcement also uncovers child sexual abuse that might otherwise not have come to the attention of authorities. It says it reviewed 22 million still images and videos of suspected child sex abuse as part of its victim identification program in 2013 - a jump of more than 5,000 percent since 2007. Once nearly eradicated in this country, child pornography has exploded over the Internet, and some in law enforcement say New Mexico is considered by child pornographers to be a good place to set up shop because of weak penalties. The National Center for Missing amp; Exploited Children says law enforcement has identified more than 9,600 child victims of pornography worldwide by name but, according to one estimate, 5 million children have been victimized. Maez says the problem of child porn is worse in New Mexico than in most states, because of a law that limits the extent of prosecution. Special Agent Jay Ratliff is one of three forensic examiners in the state Attorney General's Office who inspect seized digital devices for evidence of child pornography and download videos and images for prosecutors. Anthony Maez heads the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Unit and the New Mexico Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.

7706,"Looking at the trend lines in the responses over the past 40 years, you cannot help but be struck by an unyielding, even poignant pattern: the future, once it finally arrives, never lives up to todays expectations of it. On the stability front, consider this: In the 16 times that Gallup and Pew have asked this question since 1964 through good times and bad times, through war and peace, through recessions and booms, through Republican eras and Democratic eras the present always gets a higher mean rating than the past, and the future always gets a higher mean rating than the present. For when you look at the publics ratings of the present from one year to the next, you see that it almost never changes. Moreover, the surveys show a sharp divergence since the turn of the century in the way Democrats and Republicans evaluate their lives. This same anomaly shows up every time this survey has been taken over the past four decades, and it also applies, in reverse, to perceptions of the past (the public always rates the past worse in retrospect than they rated it at the time). So the paradox boils down to this: if the publics ratings at any given point in time are to be taken at face value, the typical Americans quality of life is constantly improving over time. But the basic story they tell is the same since the turn of the century, Americas optimists have grown fewer in number and more Republican in makeup. This was an election that many voters treated as a referendum on the Bush era, and the inherently partisan setting of the poll (taken among voters as they are leaving the polling place) may have primed Democratic respondents to see a dark future and Republican respondents to see a bright one. For a detailed look at how different demographic groups in the United States, as well as different national publics around the globe, assess their progress in life, go to Americans See Less Progress on Their Ladder of Life. Theyre simply asked to assign numerical ratings to their life at three different points in time.

5419,"But if you from a pure heart want to celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25th, and your sins have been paid for, and you are eagerly looking forward to His soon return, then I only have one thing to say to you - Merry Christmas. Let me begin this article by hitting a direct shot across the bow of what is wrong, from the bible's perspective, with the idea of Christians celebrating Christmas as it has come to be known in America. Why, thus: Long before the fourth century, and long before the Christian era itself, a festival was celebrated among the heathen, at that precise time of the year, in honour of the birth of the son of the Babylonian queen of heaven; and it may fairly be presumed that, in order to conciliate the heathen, and to swell the number of the nominal adherents of Christianity, the same festival was adopted by the Roman Church, giving it only the name of Christ. If Christmas has any meaning at all to the Christian, it is about the birth of the promised Messiah Jesus In the left sidebar, I list a series of points based on Scripture, why Santa Claus is a satanic creation and something that no bible believer should have anything to do with. It is also true that the Catholic church took a pagan feast day, and renamed it as a celebration of the birth of Jesus. The 2 most common objections to the celebration of Christimas The Christmas tree: In Jeremiah 10, we read of something that sounds a lot like a modern-day Christmas tree. Conclusion: If you truly wish to celebrate the birth of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, then do it in spirit and in truth. You do not mean to give glory to the Greek god Thor, for whom the day is named. Alexander Hislop Analysis: Yes, it is true that the pagan roots of a celebration on December go back all way to ancient Babylon. HINT: If Christmas and Easter are the two times you attend church each year, then maybe you need to get saved. If you bow down to anything other than the Holy God of the bible, then you are giving worship where it ought not go. Looking At Christmas From The Bible's Perspec",1,3
1849,"The 2015 study of 41 cities in 22 states found that students attending charter schools in those areas made slightly higher academic gains in both math and reading compared to students in traditional public schools. Black students stand to make short-term academic gains: The letter, citing a study from Stanfords Center for Research on Educational Outcomes (CREDO), argues that black students benefit from added exposure to charter schools. For many urban Black families, charter schools are making it possible to do what affluent families have long been able to do: rescue their children from failing schools, the letter notes, adding: Making charter schools the enemy in a fight for adequate education funding doesnt serve the interest of all students. A recent survey conducted by the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools showed that at least 80 percent of black, Hispanic, and low-income parents supported the opening of charter schools in their area. In the long run, according to a study of outcomes for students in Chicago and Florida, students attending charter high schools were more likely to graduate, stay in college, and earn more money than students in traditional public schools, according to a 2014 report by Mathematica. While the charter school industry is littered with the occasional bad actor, and some charters have even been found to practice skimmingillegally screening out potentially challenging students, according to a 2013 Reuters investigation and a recent report by the ACLU and Public Advocates, a public interest law firmthe pro-charter letter highlighted research showing the positive academic benefits and opportunities for black students at charters.

Simply put, Flotek Industries may not return to historical levels of profitability, even once product volumes recover. One big reason has been the devastating loss of citrus crops to citrus greening disease, which has put pressure on citrus oil prices for Flotek Industries in recent years. The finer details of how and where Flotek Industries sources its raw materials explains why the stock has suffered even as others in the oil and gas services industry have benefited from increased investment in drilling across the continent. Worse, since the citrus industry has largely resisted the potential of biotech genetic traits to ease the impact of citrus greening disease, the industry's problems -- and the company's margins -- may only get worse from here. Although management has promised to corral pricing volatility with new product formulations and pricing options, those efforts have yet to show any signs of a payoff for shareholders.

True, hes won only about 1 percent of the votes needed to win the nomination, and hes about to compete in southern states where his Northeastern reserve is likely to go over less well than in New Hampshire and Iowa. Kerry looked moderate next to Dean, but some people are taking a second look, now that hes in the lead, and deciding that hes actually a lefty. Senate Slip-Up Part of the reason Kerry has this consistency problem is that simply by virtue of being a Senator, he has a long paper trail of voting records that can be dissected by both Democratics and team Bush. Kerry is striving to thaw his patrician chill, but Iowa and New Hampshire did not give him occasion to bond with the NASCAR dads, Hispanic and African-American voters who will be a big part of the Democratic electorate now that the campaign has headed south. Critics also argue that Kerry, never one for detail, didnt achieve much of a legislative legacy. Yes, Kerry is a formidable candidate, but the race is still in its early days, and anything could happen.

General Assembly today that condemns mass electronic surveillance as a clear violation of core privacy rights guaranteed by multiple#160;treaties and conventions. Central to the Rapporteurs findings is the distinction between targeted surveillance which depend[s] upon the existence of prior suspicion of the targeted individual or organization and mass surveillance, whereby#160;states with high levels of Internet penetration can []#160;gain access to the telephone and e-mail content of an effectively unlimited number of users and maintain an overview of Internet activity associated with particular websites. The hard truth is that the use of mass surveillance technology effectively does away with the right to privacy of communications on the Internet altogether, the report concluded. Mass surveillance thus amounts to#160;a systematic interference with the right to respect for the privacy of communications, it declared. In concluding that#160;mass surveillance impinges core privacy rights, the report was primarily focused on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty enacted by the General Assembly in 1966, to which all of the members of the Five Eyes alliance are signatories. The communications of literally every Internet user are potentially open for inspection by intelligence and law enforcement agencies in the States concerned. As a result, it is incompatible with existing concepts of privacy for States to collect all communications or metadata all the time indiscriminately. In a system of mass surveillance, the report explained, all of this is possible without any prior suspicion related to a specific individual or organization. The U.S. ratified the treaty in 1992, albeit with various reservations#160;that allowed for the continuation of the death penalty and which rendered its domestic law supreme.

Benedict responded that the world presss obsession with latex had not only distorted coverage of his March 2009 pastoral visit to Africa; it had also deflected attention from the fact that, as the Pope put it, the Church is second to none in treating so many AIDS victims, especially children with AIDS.

Rather, the international discussion has been re-focused on condoms, with the Church now being mocked for being so late in recognizing reality (the condom-as-papal-miter is now a staple of editorial cartooning); gay activists have been reinforced in their conviction that sufficient pressure will bring the Catholic Church to heel on a variety of controverted issues, including the question of who may marry whom; and governments have likely been emboldened to dun Catholic health care institutions into accepting secular standards on issues ranging from Plan-B contraception to abortion to methods of AIDS prevention.

Greg Berlanti and Sarah Schechter, whose Berlanti Productions produces the shows with Warner Bros., said in a statement, Warner Bros. Television Group recently concluded its investigation into the allegations against Andrew Kreisberg. Berlanti and Schechter met with the casts and crews of their series in the days after the allegations surfaced in a Variety report. ‘Flash,’ ‘Arrow’ EP Andrew Kreisberg Fired Amid Harassment Allegations.Andrew Kreisberg has been fired from his role as executive producer on superhero dramas The Flash, Arrow, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow amid multiple allegations of sexual harassment.

8645,"Continue Reading Below The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets most Fed monetary policy, meets for two days beginning Tuesday and ending Wednesday with the release of a forecast and announcement on potential policy changes. What investors will be looking for is commentary from Bernanke that could shed light on the debate within the FOMC over the timing and scope of scaling back the Feds $85 billion-a-month bond buying program. Investors will be glued to news from the Federal Reserve next week, looking for clues as to when and how the central bank may start shifting away from its easy money policies. During Congressional testimony last month, Bernanke said the Fed might consider tapering the program over the next several months. Meanwhile, the minutes from the Feds meeting in May indicated that some Fed members wanted to begin tapering as early as June. Investors on Wednesday will be seeking reconciliation between dovish Fed members such as Bernanke who are taking a cautious approach, and hawkish members who believe its time to start reining in all that easy money. Several housing reports are also due next week, including on Monday the National Association of Home Builders housing market index, which gauges demand for new homes; on Tuesday a report on housing starts which also measures construction demand; and on Thursday a report on existing home sales. For months the Fed has cautiously maintained a position that the U.S. economy is gradually healing, but not enough yet to justify tightening monetary policy. That remark set off weeks of market gyrations and speculation over the #160;#160;Feds direction.

This isnt to say that Trump should continue quietly stoking aggressive physical conflict at his events, or defending his campaign manager for his now-repeated use of physical force at Trumps events (Trumps comment: I give him credit for having spirit).

Feds: US testing of Ebola vaccine for safety to start next week with 20 healthy patients.Federal researchers next week will start testing humans with an experimental vaccine to prevent the deadly Ebola virus. Also sometime in fall, Canadian and U.S. health officials will start safety testing a different type of Ebola vaccine developed by NewLink Genetics Corp. of Ames, Iowa. Fauci doesn't expect results from this initial round of testing until the end of the year, emphasizing that public health measures such as quarantine, isolation, infection control and personal protective devices are still the best way to fight the outbreak that so far has killed at least 1,552 people in West Africa. Fauci said the vaccine cannot cause Ebola in the volunteers being tested. This testing ""is exactly what needs to be done,"" said Pardis Sabeti, a Harvard University professor who has been studying Ebola and was in Africa working the outbreak.

Then a different version of the vaccine, using only the Zaire strain, will be tested on another 20 adults in October at NIH and elsewhere in the United States.

ADVERTISEMENT A poll conducted by Latino Decisions, a Seattle-based polling firm specializing in Hispanic opinion, and Americas Voice, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that works to secure rights for illegal immigrants, found that immigration was second only to the economy among political issues important to New Mexico Hispanics. A Journal poll in 2010 showed that 72 percent of all New Mexico voters regardless of ethnicity opposed New Mexicos drivers license law. He also said the sometimes negative tenor of the debate surrounding immigration reform could play a role in the shifting opinions among New Mexico Hispanics. In other words, a lot of New Mexico Hispanics didnt cross a border legally or illegally to get here, so they dont care as much about the often volatile issues related to immigration policy. Latino voters who maybe five or 10 years ago didnt think much about immigration policy, they now pay attention to whats happening in neighboring states, Sanchez said.

The overall poll results suggest that New Mexico politicians, some of whom might have been a bit dismissive of voter sensitivity to immigration reform proposals in the past, may want to rethink that approach. Conventional political wisdom holds that immigration is not as big an issue in New Mexico as it is in some other Southwestern states especially Arizona and Texas because many Hispanic families in New Mexico have been here for generations and trace their roots to Spanish conquistadors, not Mexican immigrants.

But Lazio and his allies were not taking into account a moment during the debate that was not immediately or widely recognized as being a problem for him.#160; This key exchange came at the end of the debate, when Lazio interrupted Clinton mid-sentence, walked across the stage with a campaign finance pledge in hand, and urged her to sign it. But the men who want to take on Clinton will need to be careful to steer clear of sexist tropes that will repel female voters and could rebound to boost Hillary, Solis Doyle maintains. But the charges seem to stick to Republicans more often because they fit the narrative that we have, says Kathleen Dolan, a political scientist at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who also focuses on these issues. Several polls had shown the Republican congressman ahead of the first lady in the race for New Yorks open Senate seat, and Lazio and his team felt the debate had bolstered his lead.

2099,"Instead of repealing the ACA, New Dems urge Speaker Ryan to work across the aisle to make constructive improvements to expand access to regular care to even more people. Repealing the ACA threatens to interrupt care, price millions of Americans out of their health insurance, and have far-reaching consequences that will destabilize markets for all Americans, regardless of how they access health care coverage. Instead of repealing, we are open to working with you to make constructive improvements to the Affordable Care Act that reduce health care costs for families and seniors, invest in prevention, increase choices for consumers, streamline regulations, reduce burdens for small businesses, and encourage participation by the young and healthy. Access to lifesaving health care is not a partisan issue, and any changes to the Affordable Care Act should reflect this shared value of ours through a commitment to bipartisan dialogue. Beyond the direct benefits of expanded coverage, a healthy workforce enables entrepreneurs to start new businesses without worrying about access to health care coverage. We hope that you will take these factors into consideration and work with Members from both parties to responsibly work towards the goal of high quality, affordable health coverage for every American. We believe there are productive changes that can be made to improve the Affordable Care Act without compromising the critical protections our constituents depend on. Access to lifesaving health care is not a partisan issue, and any improvements to the ACA will only occur through bipartisan cooperation. Not only will this jeopardize access to health care for those who need it most, the anticipated burden of uncompensated care costs will cripple health care providers ability to meet the needs of their communities.

14371,"Four more officials charged with felonies in Flint water crisis..................................................................................................................................................................................... Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette filed another round of criminal charges Tuesday in the ongoing water crisis in Flint, the latest action in a nearly year-long investigation to hold accountable those responsible for a disaster that exposed thousands of children to dangerously high lead levels. Prosecutors allege that the emergency managers conspired with two Flint employees, public works Superintendent Howard Croft and utilities Administrator Daugherty Johnson, to enter into a contract under false pretenses that bound the city to use the river for its drinking water, even though the local water plant was in no condition to properly deliver safe water to residents. Schuette announced felony charges against four people, including two former state-appointed emergency managers who oversaw a disastrous switch of the citys drinking water source to the Flint River. Those charges, against three Department of Health and Human Services employees and three from the Department of Environmental Quality, included claims that some had hid or disregarded test results showing high lead levels in the blood of Flint residents and had tampered with water test results sent to federal officials. ADVERTISEMENT Even after the officials were told repeatedly that the Flint water department wasnt ready to make the switch in 2014 and that the city should keep getting its water from Detroit, investigators say Earley and Ambrose pushed the change forward in a bid to save money. In June, Schuette filed civil charges against two engineering firms that allegedly botched their work on the water supply system, contributing to the crisis. The following month, six more state employees were charged with misconduct in office for their alleged roles in contaminating Flints water supply. In April, Schuette announced initial charges against three state and local workers for their roles in the water crisis. In April 2014, with the city under the control of Earley, an emergency manager appointed by the governor, officials followed through on an earlier decision to switch to the Flint River to save money.

1369,"In his fantastic book The Opposable Mind, Roger Martin demonstrates how great leaders have the unique ability to hold opposing ideas in tension and find a third way through choices that to the average person appear to offer only two paths. The greatest gift followers of Christ could give the church and the world right now is the demonstration of how to hold two competing ideas in tension without breaking. This dilemma assumes a zero-sum game, even among those of us who know intellectually that giving recognition to others doesnt have to take away our own identity. While that is indeed true, neither would I issue a blanket decree that no one could enter my house for four months while I got my guest-vetting process in order. Another way to see this is to ask what is your starting position in viewing the nature of the world around you. Looking back, this is one of the lessons I learned from my mother, although she may never have known what to call it. Isn’t there a third way through our disagreements?.As a child of the Depression, my mother developed two guiding principles that on the surface might seem at odds with each other. Always seeing the world as an innocent place can get you killed. The call to peacemaking is, instead, a call to integrative thinking, acknowledging two contrasting ideas and finding between them the good of the whole. But no doubt these evolutionary impulses get shaped and refined by our life experiences, our education and our family and friends, our churches. Heres his definition: The ability to face constructively the tension of opposing ideas and, instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is superior to each. Always seeing the world as a scary place will cause you to live in constant fear.",0,2

This comparisonand Webbs contention that the administration would be abusing executive authority by using the EPA to restrict emissionsis an inaccurate one: The Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that the EPA has been granted the authority by Congress, via the Clean Air Act, to regulate carbon dioxide. Senator Webb advanced similar arguments, concerning congressional engagement and approval, in August 2008 during the Bush Administrations negotiation of the Iraq Security Agreements. Since his campaign for the U.S. Senate, one of Senator Webbs principal themes has been to restore and maintain the proper balance of power between the executive branch and Congress. As I reported earlier, it looks likely that Virginia Democrat Jim Webb will support Republican Lisa Murkowskis efforts to bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide emissions. By citing the Iraq Security Agreements, Webb is referring to the attempt by the Bush administration in 2008 to unilaterally forge a long-term security arrangement with the government of Iraq. An executive branch decision to broadly interpret a legislative statuteespecially one involving sweeping implications for our countrywithout such direction from Congress is inappropriate. He has said on related issues for many years that the regulatory power of the executive branch is derived specifically from the legislative branch.

Trumps suggestion of a higher corporate tax rate than what has been included in legislation approved by the House and Senate represented an about-face after the president and administration officials maintained a hard line that a corporate rate higher than 20 percent was a nonstarter. Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech to the Tax Foundation in mid-November that the administration would cut the corporate tax rate from one of the highest in the developed world down to 20 percent and not a penny more.

9315,"New York Citys case is built on the theory that gun companies know their products end up being trafficked to criminals and could take easy steps to stop it, but fail to do so. The year before, the NAACP had filed a public-nuisance suit on behalf of its membersin effect, potential victims of gun violencetrying to force a change in the industrys marketing practices, but that effort was not yet far along. Nonetheless, gun-control advocates see in the New York case a real possibility to force manufacturers to change the way they market and distribute their products. As theres no precedent linking industry sales practices to a public nuisance, the first challenge is to show that the defendants owe the plaintiffs a legal duty, not just a moral or ethical one, says Ralph Stein, a professor at Pace University School of Law whos followed the case. While this virtually ensured that the case would soon be the first of its kind to go to trial, it also seemed to prompt the white-shoe law firm that had been helping the city, Weil, Gotshal amp; Manges, to pull out of the case. Twelve years after the tragedy that still haunts his firm, and as he prepares to launch what may be the most significant case in the history of gun litigation, Michael Elkin is confident of both short- and long-term victory. A Weil Gotshal lawyer told the Times that its client might have a point: that even the appearance of a conflict could leave it open to the charge that it softened its advocacy for the city. It has to bring home to the jury that the citys action, if successful, would protect all New Yorkers, starting with these 12 people, says Stein. New York City had to make a different kind of argument from plaintiffs in traditional liability suits, in which manufacturers are held responsible for defective products, rather than ones that work all too well. Judges have shown resistance to cases that smack of regulating an industry through the courts (which is why a state appeals panel would later toss a similar suit brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer). #160; ITS A PARADOX that has",1,1

ADVERTISEMENT We have many questions related to the audit and its aftermath, including: the apparent lack of due process allotted to mental health providers; the clandestine nature of the investigation in which even the accused do not have full access to audit results; the enormous expenditure of state funds to Boston and Arizona firms while Optum is paid generously to provide oversight of Medicaid providers; and the purportedly glowing evaluations from Optum of the same nonprofits under investigation. Reports from colleagues in affected agencies and patients describe a chaotic atmosphere of uncertainty in which patient care has been unduly disrupted. The recent audit of mental health agencies commissioned by the state Department of Human Services, followed by the abrupt disruption of the majority of mental health services in the state, is of grave concern. Above all, patient care must be preserved without disturbance. Instead, we choose to focus on two areas in which we have expertise: patient care and the clinician-patient relationship. Some providers will leave our state because of the process of reorganizing mental health care. While potentially fraudulent behavior on the part of any health agency should and must be investigated, the process of the investigation must be conducted in a transparent, fair and minimally disruptive manner.

Not Great..Since he humiliated their preferred presidential candidate in November, the folks at Saturday Night Live have dedicated increasingly more of their collective energy to lampooning Donald Trump and anyone associated with him. They've trotted out Alec Baldwin to do his pouty Trump impersonation, repeatedly mocked Trump's bromance with Putin, and portrayed Kellyanne Conway as a sexual predatorwilling to kill for airtime a skit so tasteless even the New York Times had to acknowledge its "" queasy edge of sexism."" Below is the Conway skit that even the New York Times had a tough time stomaching, followed by the actually funny Spicer skit: A total of 33 percent said they ""would like to see more"" skits targeting Trump and his administration. While a few of the Trump-themed sketches have been a success, like Melissa McCarthy's impersonation of Sean Spicer at least the first time she did it there have been several duds.

9943,"Longer-term loans of 73 to 84 months saw the fastest rate of growth for both new and used car buyers. But, if the loan goes bad, it could keep consumers out of the market longer, since the consumer has negative equity which would require them to hold on to the vehicle longer. Insider Q&A: Experian's Zabritski on the surge in auto loans..................................................................................................................................................................................... With gas prices low, consumers are buying more SUVs and trucks and loading them up with new technology, like backup cameras and automatic braking. This helps make used vehicles more affordable, which in turn reduces the finance amount and associated payment. One of the impacts of the growing lease market is a surge in late-model off-lease vehicles returning to market. What are the implications for the auto industry if people are taking longer and longer to pay off their vehicles? As a result, the average new-car loan approached $30,000 in the fourth quarter of last year, setting a record, according to Experian Automotive. If we see an increase in less expensive vehicles, it could help drive down amounts which could in turn impact monthly payments. In addition to overall price increases, finance amounts are in part reflective of the types of vehicles consumers are purchasing. The gap between new and used vehicle monthly payments reached an all-time high of $134 in the fourth quarter. To lessen the blow, more buyers are opting for leases, which offer lower monthly payments. If anything, leasing will become more attractive as interest rates rise and increase loan payments.",0,0

UNM must address a nearly $9 million hole in its instruction and general budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1, and a tuition increase will cover about half of it.

Continue Reading Below After Twitter reported its fourth quarter results, it looks like a lot more analysts could be jumping on board. Noto says it's imperative for Twitter to show that it's improving engagement in order to win back revenue from those advertisers, but it will take time. Advertisement While Twitter didn't provide a revenue outlook for the first quarter, it did offer a few details. It seems advertisers are shifting more of their budgets to Facebook and Snap, and that's backed up by Noto's statement that it saw increased competition starting in mid-January. When asked if Twitter can grow revenue at all for the full year, Noto didn't provide a direct answer. He pointed out the company still makes the majority of its revenue from brand advertisers, which have long lead times for buying ads. Twitter's outlook implies revenue somewhere between $428 million and $559 million in the first quarter. Noto's expectations that showing advertisers the improving engagement rates on Twitter will help turn around seems like wishful thinking. Granted, Twitter made a major overhaul to its sales team last quarter, which prompted it not to release any guidance for the quarter.

One hybrid way to invest in gold is to buy shares of gold streaming companies. If you want gold as part of your investment portfolio, you can pick from several smart gold investing choices, each of which has different investment characteristics. Warren Buffett has argued that gold is far inferior to stocks as an investment, but others note that the yellow metal has risen in value over time and has a safe-haven status to protect against loss of confidence in financial systems. The benefit of gold ETFs is that you can buy or sell shares anytime the stock market is open, and the transaction costs are a lot lower than with physical bullion purchases and sales. Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years, but the idea of gold as an investment generates plenty of controversy. The benefit of streaming companies is that they have exposure to gold prices but also get a stream of income from their financing arrangements. Gold mining stocks, however, are active businesses, and although their prospects are linked to gold prices, mining companies can also rise when they have fundamental success in their operations. Moreover, when gold falls, some mining stocks have even greater downward volatility. For instance, streaming company Franco-Nevada (NYSE: FNV) has steadily raised its dividend for nearly a decade, and although Franco-Nevada's current yield of around 1.3% is less than the market average, it's quite a bit better than what most gold mining stocks pay.

His passion was to see the British governed Northern Ireland where he was born, reunited with the southern Republic of Ireland; sovereign and independent of British political domination. Part of that changing world was the birth and rise of a civil rights movement in Northern Ireland. The movement presented Stormont and Londons Westminster with a set of demands, as the basis for achieving civil rights where they had long been denied. So the dirty baggage did not suit the image of a forward looking group of countries, sworn to no more wars on European soil and a common market of economic, social and cultural cooperation. While some talked of civil rights for Catholics as their preferred option of change the Stormont government stayed consistently stagnant. Direct rule from London, in one form or another, seems to be the next stop, the British general election of 8 June being an inconvenient distraction. But along with others, those who stood in the way of civil rights, which started half a century ago this year, he is part of history sorry, glorious or whatever. He earned a living by working in a butchers shop, as a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, becoming Minister of Education and later Deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland government.

10406,"For perspective, about half of renters and a third of homeowners with a mortgage fail to get to 30% or less.But please don't use ""Tommy's mom let him spend 50% of his earnings on a condo"" as an excuse to overspend -- remember, WAY too many people are pretty darn awful with their money. But also remember that you're committing to 360 months of payments, so saving up 20% of the price of the house helps ensure you have the discipline to see it through, is a check against buying beyond your means, and is just a smart, conservative thing to do. But fortunately, with housing there are five fairly simple numbers we can look at to help suss out when buying a home is clearly a bad financial idea.I've rank-ordered them, starting with... Advertisement The first and important metric to check is whether you can afford it. Unless the price-to-rent ratio is amazingly low, I'd ask them to really think about whether the costs, risks, and pain of owning a house are worth it versus just saving up more money to buy when they're ready to fully commit. On a $200,000 house with 20% down, that means someone with a credit score of 740 or higher (850 maximum) could save about $140 a month versus someone with a low-but-approvable credit score.$140 a month may or may not sound like a lot to you, but that's a whopping $50,000 discount over the life of a 30-year mortgage. The exception: If you are willing and able to rent out your house to cover your mortgage, insurance, taxes, homeowner fees, maintenance, and any property management costs, it could make sense to buy at five years or even fewer. Put another way, it would take 16.7 years' worth of rent to buy the house in cash today. Under 20% is a tough goal in many housing markets, but if you can achieve that with a 30-year fixed mortgage, you're probably in really good shape unless your income takes an unexpected hit. What this means from a practical standpoint for folks who have a hard time saving is that if you limit your housing costs to a low percentage of your income and ensure that your price-to-rent",1,3

683,"If successful, this new made-in-America Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere would open up the pension funds and other savings vehicles of what had been the fastest-growing and highest-saving countries in the world to money managers like Goldman, and create lucrative new markets for securities placement, debt stretch-out, privatizations, mergers, and acquisitions (at fire-sale prices). With its commanding presence in the capital markets of New York, London, Frankfurt, and, increasingly, Tokyo, Goldman is one of the worlds most consistently successful financial houses, earning billions since Corzine took the helm in 1994. As one Asian country after another collapsed and appealed to the U.S. and the International Monetary Fund (which relates to the U.S. Treasury rather like the RCA Victor dog did to the talking machine in the logo) for rescue funds, the Americans drew a line in the sand: They made aid contingent upon sweeping privatization of state-directed (and, over the last generation, fabulously successful) Asian economies. In place of the usual closed circle of state-encouraged, national champion firms borrowing vast amounts of money from government-controlled savings systems at concessionary rates, the U.S. Treasury demanded the creation, virtually overnight, of American-style transparent markets for stocks and bonds. Likened by the former head of one major Japanese bank to a new MacArthur scenario, this approach would have institutionalized the open markets for money, foreign exchange, and securities that firms like Goldman thrive on. The U.S. and the IMF also insisted upon sweeping accounting reforms, far-reaching financial deregulation, balanced budgets, higher interest rates, and freely convertible foreign exchange markets overseen by independent central banks. Not surprisingly, the firm has long had a reputation for being close to those in power, as, for example, in the Clinton administration, where Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a former Goldman chair, has been uniquely influential.

If California high school students were required to take one yearlong computer science program to graduate, thats a lot of displaced teachers. Yet there is another reason why California high school graduation rules reflect the values of the Golden State of the Eisenhower and Kennedy years: Changing graduation requirements threatens to put not just a few thousand but tens of thousands of teachers out on the streets. 20, 2013 By Chris Reed The reports earlier this month that the state will no longer require eighth-graders to take Algebra 1 and allow them instead to take a somewhat less rigorous course covering algebra touched off a minor flap between those who saw this as dumbing-down standards and those who noted that the less rigorous course was better preparation for new state standardized tests. When I interviewed Weber in 2011, I asked the San Diego State president about the game-changing A Nation at Risk report issued by a federal commission in 1983 that kicked off the education reform movement with this instantly famous description of the U.S. school system: If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.

3753,"During the company's Q1 2016 earnings conference call this month on May 4, management confirmed that it's making progress on its plan to refranchise certain properties, as well as sell a portion of its valuable real estate portfolio in Mexico. In late March of 2016, Arcos' Brazilian subsidiary signed a secured loan agreement of $167.3 million with a consortium of five lenders, enabling the organization to repay the real denominated notes of roughly the same amount, which are due in 2016. While challenges abound, in particular a stagnant economy in its biggest market of Brazil, Arcos has at least proven through its debt reduction that it can be viable going forward. The appreciation reflected continued investor confidence that a three-year strategic plan initiated by management has the potential to turn the company's fortunes around. After Standard amp; Poor's rating agency downgraded Brazilian debt to ""junk"" status in September of 2015, shareholders fretted that Arcos' already high financing costs would begin to soar.

Related: Florida's 4 Zika Cases Likely Came From Local Mosquitoes Once summer hit, experts have been anticipating the first cases of local transmission especially in hot, humid areas like Florida where a big population of the Aedes aegypti mosquito is able to spread Zika. Although no mosquitoes have tested positive for the Zika virus yet, Florida health officials believe that active transmission of the Zika virus is occurring in a one-square-mile area just north of downtown Miami. The Florida Department of Health reported Friday that the four people a woman and three men infected earlier this month in Miami are the first known homegrown cases of Zika virus in the US. We continue to recommend that everyone in areas where Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are presentand especially pregnant womentake steps to avoid mosquito bites,"" Frieden said Friday. Doctors also say evidence suggests that once infected with the Zika virus people develop an immunity. There's no cure for Zika infection but fortunately for most people, the infection is mild and clears up in about a week. We anticipate that there may be additional cases of homegrown Zika in the coming weeks, Dr. Lyle Petersen of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.

8652,"After all, Alabama isnt the first state to argue that the Voting Rights Act forced it to redistrict in a way that packed minorities into districts and diluted their political power. Last year, the states Shelby County persuaded the US Supreme Court to find unconstitutional part of the Voting Rights Act that required certain states with histories of discriminatory election laws to get permission from the federal government before changing their voting practices. Alabama has defended itself in the case by arguing that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act required the state, during the redistricting process, to maintain the same number of majority-minority districts, with roughly the same percentage of minority voters. On Wednesday, Alabama will argue before the court that the same provision it helped decimate compelled lawmakers to racially gerrymander the entire state. He noted that even as the state was arguing before the Supreme Court in the Shelby County case that Section 5 should be struck down as unconstitutional, it was relying on racial quotasand seeking to justify those quotas with the very provision it was helping to render inert. But the federal government could still enforce Section 5 at the time of the Alabama redistricting (a fact that now further complicates the case at the Supreme Court). In that case, the court invalidated another part of the law, rendering Section 5 unenforceable and freeing states like Alabama from federal oversight of its voting laws and redistricting plans on the grounds that times had changed. But state legislators also redrew the lines in a way that minimized the influence of African American voters in districts where they did not make up a majority of voters. In Alabama, race is often a proxy for party, making the case even more complicated, as the states redistricting decisions are political as well as potentially discriminatory. In 2012, a group of African American state legislators and other activists filed two lawsuits against the state challenging the redistricting plan as unconstitutional and a violation of the Voting Rights Act.

7326,"(The Associated Press) Justices will hear arguments Tuesday in a case that considers whether employers can defend discrimination lawsuits by asserting that government lawyers did not try hard enough to settle claims before going to court. Lawyers for Mach Mining argue that judicial review of the conciliation process is needed to find out whether the EEOC complied with basic steps such as giving an employer enough information about the charges or providing enough time to respond to settlement offers. Many employers confronted with claims of workplace bias would rather negotiate a minimal settlement with the EEOC and pledge to fix the problems than mount a costly legal defense in court. In an unusual move, the EEOC also asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. The case before the high court involves an Illinois mining company sued by the EEOC in 2011 for failing to hire any female workers despite receiving applications from many qualified women. The Supreme Court could put the brakes on the Obama administrations growing crackdown against companies facing claims of discrimination in hiring practices. Mach Mining says the suit should be thrown out because the commission did not try in good faith to reach a settlement before taking the company to court. A federal judge agreed to look into whether the EEOCs attempt to settle the case was sincere and reasonable. Companies are complaining increasingly about the Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions systemic litigation program, which turns individual complaints of bias into high-stakes class-action cases on behalf of dozens or even hundreds of workers. The Justice Department argues that allowing employers to question the governments settlement efforts at all undermines law enforcement and only encourages companies to drag out settlement talks. But the EEOC may choose to sue if it is unable to reach a settlement that is acceptable to the commission. The enforcement strategy has netted over $100 million in legal judgments and settlements from more than 50 companies since 2011, including $20 million from Verizon Inc. to settle allegations that the company unfairly fired or disciplined hundreds of disabled workers for missing work.",0,0

9470,"Now, before you send me an email asking when was the last time I preached to a television audience and an arena-full of people, let me say I am sure Brother Osteen does much good for the kingdom of God despite his deplorable theology. How else can you describe matters when most churchgoing adults reject the accuracy of the Bible, reject the existence of Satan, claim that Jesus sinned, see no need to evangelize, believe that good works are one of the keys to persuading God to forgive their sins, and describe their commitment to Christianity as moderate or even less firm? It would be sobering enough if it were only true that Christians do not know what the Bible teaches. OK. We all agree that Americans, Baptists and even Baptist preachers (and most especially Baptist editors) need to know more of the Bible (unless someone will actually say, No, I know all of the Bible it is possible to know.) Ask any school teacher who is a Christian, and chances are you will be told that contemporary students know far less about biblical references, characters and stories than previous generations of young scholars. We need to read the Bible in church, of course, but hearing the Bible read in worship will never replace the personal time spent reading and meditating on what God is saying. But as disconcerting as our cultural biblical illiteracy is, what is infinitely more troubling is that even church-goers come up short in the Bible knowledge department. Last Sunday morning as I was dressing for church I heard Joel Osteen tell an arena-full of people and the television audience that God wants them to be at ease.

Sorting out what happened, who authorized the attack, and what the motivations behind it were is not an academic exercise, but one that goes to the heart of the Bush Administrations pre-emptive war policy and the problems the doctrine presents to the in-coming Obama Administration. Elevating terrorism to imminent danger has allowed the Bush Administration to invade two countries, expand the powers of the executive, undermine constitutional checks on surveillance, and ignore U.S. and international laws on torture and incarceration. According to the Financial Times, the Bush Administration has discussed who should replace Assad, and National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley was put in charge of the operation. Abrams has long been close to Benjamin Netanyahu, who may be Israels next prime minister and who is implacably opposed to negotiations with either Syria or the Palestinians. Since the aggressors in WW IINazi Germany, fascist Italy, and imperial Japanall claimed they were fighting preventive wars, the UN insisted that only an actual or imminent armed attack could trigger an all-out conflict. When President George W Bush outlined the strategy of pre-emptive war in his 2002 West Point address, he broke with more than 50 years of international law and a central tenent of the United Nations Charter. The U.S., the Soviet Union, China, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Israel, South Africa, Morocco and Britain all invaded other nations without bothering to get the blessing of the Security Council, mostly because it would not have been forthcoming. But in the name of liberal interventionism, the Clinton Administration and NATO openly broke with the covenant in 1999 and launched a 75-day air war on Serbia.

Given the massive size of Boeing's backlog -- it still has about 5,700 firm orders on the books -- a minor slowdown in order activity like this isn't a cause for worry. To hone its focus on this area, Boeing decided in late 2016 to create a third major business unit focused on services, combining parts of its current commercial and defense segments. Just as importantly, the company offered a relatively favorable outlook for 2017, punctuated by its guidance that free cash flow will rise by roughly $550 million year over year, reaching nearly $8.5 billion. However, with monthly deliveries of the cash-cow 777 model set to decline by half over the next year or so, investors were understandably nervous about the outlook for 2018. Indeed, Boeing expects the tanker program to turn cash positive in 2018 and become a reliable source of cash flow for decades thereafter. Furthermore, the efficiency benefits of the new models will make them much more marketable in the long run than the current-generation 777. Continue Reading Below After the earnings release, Boeing executives spent some time discussing the company's results and outlook with analysts and the media. Given the steep drop in demand experienced by the 777 program recently, it is more important than ever to get production of the next-generation 777X model up and running smoothly. Some analysts expect another big decline in orders this year.",1,3
8509,"Why We Can’t Stop Talking About Andy Warhol.Since Andy Warhols death in 1987, I have been asked the same question at least a thousand times: Did you have any idea, when you were working for Andy in the 1970s, how important and expensive he would become? Your son and Pat Hackett put all those big words in Andys mouth in his so- called Philosophy book that made people think he was brilliant. As Billy Name, the photographer- in- residence at the first of Andys four successive Factories (the one with the silver walls and nonstop parties), said in a 2006 PBS documentary, He wanted it so much, to be successful. The only thing Andy could think to say after he met people was Are they rich? All the great modern American themesindividualism, capitalism, consumerism, religion, sex, addiction, deathare there, but presented so casually, even flippantly, as to make them easy to go down, to make them cool, as Gagosian would say. But a gift for prophecy does not fully explain Warhols omnipresence, nor why massive numbers of people who know almost nothing about art relate to his. Sometimes it seems a kind of transubstantiation has occurred, a commercial version of Catholic Communion, through which Warhol has become the world, and the world has become Warhol. For them, Andy was the Chauncey Gardiner character in the 1979 movie Being There: a simpleton turned into a god for uttering pseudo profundities, such as Life is a state of mind. During the second half of the twentieth century America was the new Rome, the dominant world empire, but a very insecure one, eager to assert itself but increasingly ashamed of having done so. Now, a quarter century after his death, it has become almost a clich to say that Andy Warhol was the most important artist of the second half of the twentieth century, just as Picasso was of the first half. One cannot avoid Andys most prescient lineIn the future everyone will be world famous for fifteen minutesprobably because it rings truer every day.

If convicted, Manning could face indefinite solitary confinement, reclassification into maximum security and an additional nine years in medium custody, the ACLU said in a press release. On Thursday, Manning's attorneys at the American Civil Liberties Union learned that the Army had informed her she was being investigated for serious new charges related to the suicide attempt. Manning, who was convicted in 2013 on espionage charges for sending more than 700,000 classified documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, was briefly hospitalized earlier this month for an unknown medical condition.

ADVERTISEMENT One girl said Hyatt was making her uncomfortable and kept asking her to have sex with her but said he would stop if she sent him four photos of herself in the nude. Hyatt had passed a criminal background check, and the district also checked references, including former employers, Sullivan said. He said Hyatt is only employed by the school during the football season and was put on administrative leave when the investigation began. When Damien Hyatt was hired by Moriarty High School as an assistant football coach two years ago, he passed his background check and didnt raise any red flags, according to Tom Sullivan, superintendent of the Moriarty-Edgewood School District. But on Wednesday, the 24-year-old coach was arrested and charged with 12 counts of raping a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor and several counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor after a 16-year-old female student told Torrance County sheriffs deputies they began dating the year before when she was 15. Our first responsibility is the safety and well-being of our young people, and from what he has been accused of doing, it certainly seems that young people were victimized in this case, he said.

7268,"Schmitt and Friedman agree that its really less about how open the space is and more about the choice and control that individual employees have along with how well the space actually reflects the intent the space was designed for and ultimately the culture of the organization. Schmitt believes that collaboration is important and smart design can certainly enhance collaboration, but work isnt just about collaboration and he feels that many open office designs miss this. Giving people the choice of where they want to work and the type of space that is best suited for them provides a feeling of control and allows people to find their flow. Freidman explains collaboration is just one facet of work and any office design needs to take that into account. Regardless of how open or closed a space may be, the key is to adapt the space to your employees and not the other way around. Schmitt advises that you make sure your space is an accurate and deliberate projection of what the organization is about and that the design resonates with your constituents in a positive way. The proliferation of open office design has had a tremendous impact on the American work experience. One of the problems is that when employees need that personal space they often create workarounds, some of which can be unhealthy. From Silicon start-ups to major corporate campuses, open offices have come to represent forward thinking design and the importance of fostering collaboration. Friedman points out there is something deeply wrong with a workspace when the only way to feel productive is to leave the building. Schmitt has come across instances where people were actually going out to work from their cars to escape distractions in the office.

Through PACE, property owners#160;who wanted to install solar or other renewable energy-generating devices or make water#160;or energy efficiency improvements to their properties borrowed funds from their#160;local government program. Californias entangled clean energy policy just added another program to an already convoluted, growing bureaucracy. And according to the staffer, there are far too many state employees currently working in green energy-related jobs in which the project financing has been milked and strung out. But this latest bill seems just to create another clean-energy program, while adding to the bureaucracy. The CEUP, offered by the California Energy Commission ( CEC), has similar goals to help put people in contact with banks for clean energy financing. The bill says, Existing law, until January 1, 2015, appropriates up to $50,000,000 from the Renewable Resource Trust Fund to the authority for the purposes of the PACE Reserve program and authorizes the authority to expend up to $300,000 of that appropriation for initial administrative costs in implementing the PACE Reserve program. But energy program financing already exists at the state level and in many of the states green-energy programs.

12083,"Instead, by bringing together some of the most engaged individuals from the governmental, industrial, financial, and academic sectors, we hope that we will be able to identify: (1) areas where there may be a degree of agreement regarding the case for government intervention; (2) some of the appropriate tools that the government could use and mechanisms for the government to take action; and (3) areas where research or future workshops may be helpful to determine the best policy options. Some reasons that have been articulated that may justify an increased government role in supporting the demonstration of energy technologies include: Options for Accelerating CommercializationIt is clear that the government cannot, and should not, support demonstration of all technologies. Several factors make the introduction of new energy technologies inherently more difficult than in other sectors. The Need to Transform the Energy SystemThere is broad political consensus that the current energy system in the United States is unable to meet the nations future energy needs, from the security, environment, and economic perspectives. These barriers can be summarized into three main categories: Does the absence of private sector investment automatically mean that there is a sound public, as well as economic, policy argument for government intervention? The Demonstration Challenge If adequately incentivized, the private sector is usually able to take on the risk and financial burden of deploying new technologies. Rapid transformation of the energy system would require wide-scale introduction and adoption of new, advanced energy technologies. But before deployment can be realized, new technologies need to be demonstrated at near-commercial scale and in operating conditions closely approximating the commercial environment in which the technology would be deployed. The heterogeneity of various energy technologies, and the energy industry itself, means that there is no one-size-fits-all or ""silver bullet"" solution. There are several barriers to private sector investment in demonstration projects, and they vary by technology and energy sub-sector. These factors, some of which are listed below, have fostered a very conservative approach to investment in technology innovation, providing a challenging backdrop for rapid transformation. New energy technologies are required to increase the availability of domestic energy supplies, to reduce the negative environmental impacts of our energy system, to improve",0,0

CLEVELAND The search for human remains from a plane that crashed into Lake Erie last month has ended, and DNA testing has identified three of the six people killed, an airport official said on Tuesday. Due to conditions in the water, it is not likely we will be able to recover additional human remains from dives at this point, Burke Lakefront Airport Commissioner Khalid Bahhur said. Divers on Tuesday recovered two large pieces of debris but no additional human remains from the Cessna Citation 525 that crashed minutes after takeoff during snowy conditions on Dec. 29. Equipment from the NTSB was used to further narrow the search area and allowed divers to find the planes cockpit voice recorder, its emergency locator transmitter and other debris. The National Transportation Safety Board said the planes cockpit voice recorder has a usable recording and a committee in Washington, D.C., will listen to and transcribe it for the investigation by the NTSB and the Federation Aviation Administration into the cause of the crash. The plane was headed back to Columbus after the six attended a Cleveland Cavaliers game that evening. ADVERTISEMENT Relatives of those killed were told on Tuesday that the recovery effort had ended, Bahhur said. The search grid for the plane was narrowed using 3D mapping and other information from about 11 square miles of Lake Erie to about 300 feet by 600 feet, Bahhur said. A decision like this one is not made lightly, but is a decision that must be made at some point to provide closure to the families and those who worked closely on this operation, Bahhur said.

Fire officials said 14 people were taken to Sunrise Hospital by early Tuesday evening for minor injuries, most a result of sliding down the inflatable chutes to escape. Firefighters stationed at the airport reached the plane two minutes after getting reports of flames, and within another three minutes, everyone inside the plane had escaped. In this photo taken from the view of a plane window, smoke billows out from a plane that caught fire at McCarren International Airport, Tuesday, Sept. 8, 2015, in Las Vegas. An engine on the British Airways plane caught fire before takeoff, forcing passengers to escape on emergency slides. The Federal Aviation Administration delayed flights to Las Vegas from some airports for more than two hours after the fire to slow the flow of planes while the disabled Boeing 777 made two of the airport's four runways inaccessible.

Although the idea of U.S. officials presiding over the detention and torture of suspected terrorists may not scandalize you anymore, their participation in the detention and torture of ethnic minorities whose only crime is to support regional autonomy ought to. You may also recall that Musharraf wasted no time rounding up and jailing human rights workerswho were also quite plausibly advocating for detainees. The New York Times reports today that Pervez Musharraf is acting quickly to release detainees who were held and interrogated with no paper trail or legal protections to get rid of evidence of the secret program. One rationale Musharraf gave for imposing emergency rule in November was that the court was releasing suspected terrorists. Pakistan was almost certainly working with the United States in its efforts to interrogate, if not prosecute, the suspected terrorists. A week into his emergency rule, Musharraf reinvigorated amended the 1952 Army Act to allow civilians to be tried by military tribunals for general offenses. To justify the move, a government spokesman said, Sometimes it becomes difficult to prove a case, but you have reasons that a person poses a threat to humanity and to society.

ADVERTISEMENT Lujan Grisham, co-chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said the Kates Law bill would criminalize immigrants who are guilty of nothing more than trying to keep their families intact. The legislation dealing with sanctuary cities called the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act mirrors a Justice Department initiative that has been tied up in federal court since April. A Department of Homeland Security report released in March noted that no county in New Mexico among some other states and counties nationwide complies with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement requests to detain those arrested for crimes if they are eligible for deportation. Local law enforcement officials should have the resources they need to protect and serve all the residents in their care, Lujn said, referencing the sanctuary cities bill. Withholding funds from first responders and the communities they serve will not improve conditions, but it will make undocumented residents who are victims of heinous crimes like rape or abuse less likely to report those incidents and it will needlessly punish communities that are doing their best to address local problems at the local level. We in New Mexico know firsthand the challenges that come with a broken and outdated immigration system, Pearce said. The other bill approved Thursday, known as Kates Law, is named in honor of Kate Steinle, a 32-year-old woman who was shot and killed in San Francisco two years ago by a man in the country illegally who had been deported five times. Nobody should face up to a decade in prison only because of their immigration status, and not any sort of criminal act. Lujan Grisham also said, Using tragedy as a political tool to justify mass deportation of all immigrants is shameful.

Continue Reading Below Friends are able to report suicidal behavior by clicking a report option next to any piece of content on the site and choosing suicidal content under the harmful behavior option, Facebook spokesman Frederic Wolens said. Users also have the ability to report suicidal behavior by going to the site's Help Center or search for suicide reporting forms. The new suicide reporting tool will be made available to people who use Facebook in the United States and Canada. Wolens said that all reporting on the site is done anonymously and so a distressed user will not know who reported the suicidal content. In the past year, more than 8 million Americans 18 or older had thought seriously about suicide, according to a blog post by the Surgeon General accompanying the release of the new Facebook tool. Facebook will then email the user in distress a direct link for a private online chat with a crisis representative from the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline as well as the group's phone number. The new tool gives people who may not be comfortable picking up the phone a direct avenue to seek help. They can also use reporting links around the site. Facebook Launches Tool to Report Suicidal Behavior. Worried friends who reported the behavior will also receive a message to say it is being addressed, Wolens said.

If Intel can succeed at reducing machine learning to a level that could reside on a processor, that would be a significant boost to its business and a potentially troubling development for NVIDIA. As the battle for AI supremacy continues, we will likely see more consolidation in the industry, as tech giants try to gain an edge in this nascent technology. Movidius brought computer-vision hardware for drones and cameras; it also provided system-on-a-chip (SoC) technology for accelerating computer vision, as well as deep-learning capability. These companies integrate directly into Intel's RealSense brand for drones and virtual reality, and bolster its IoT business. This list reveals well-known tech giants making large investments to increase their capabilities in AI. The most significant of Intel's acquisitions, however, may be that of deep-learning start-up Nervana Systems.

961,"Let me now move to my claim that in their evaluation of the invasion, analysts and politicians fail to acknowledge the cost this war is imposing on Iraqis. This record creates anger at Sunnis, Shiites, and perhaps even the foreign country that came and brought pandemonium. First, even though Americans debate the negative consequences of the war, their overriding concerns are largely self-serving. Thus, the liberation of the country went wrong because Iraqis do not want freedom. The logic of the argument goes as follows: The U.S. launched Operation Iraqi Freedom in a well-intentioned effort to liberate the country from a tyrannical oppressor, enabling the people to take charge of their own fate and create a democracy. But even though Iraqis bear an enormous burden, Pelosi does not refer to them when she says that the nation mourns those whose lives have been lost. Despite the fact that the Iraq debate brings mistakes to light, it leaves me with the impression that I am stuck in a bad movie, one that never gets at the real storyline. Let me elaborate on these two points, starting with the idea, at home in numerous Internet blogs, that Iraqis are to blame for their fate. It appears that this nation is mocking Iraqis twice by failing to see the misery which it has inflicted on them and by attributing guilt for this misery to them. Then she goes on to say: The debt which can never be repaid is to those whose lives have been lost in the war, and as a nation, we mourn them. Second, public discussion is marked by the latent claim that Iraqis are to blame for the failure of Americas military ambitions. A nation that views itself as a role model for the rest of the world must do better than inflicting suffering on others and then either blaming them for their misfortune or ignoring it entirely.",1,1

5676,"And Mirai makes it easy for a would-be attacker to scan the internet for devices to take over and turn into botnets for launching coordinated attacks, Chris Carlson of the cybersecurity firm Qualys said. Researchers say Mirai exploited security vulnerabilities in thousands of internet-connected devices such as web cameras, then used those devices to attack a major internet firm, resulting in widespread outages. While distributed denial-of-service attacks have been around for years, hackers have many more devices they can use to pull off their attacks, thanks to the proliferation of internet-connected cameras, thermostats, lights and more. Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday affecting access to many popular sites from the East Coast. These types of attacks work by overwhelming targeted computers with junk traffic, so legitimate traffic cant get through. Experts say that whatever the target, more attacks are inevitable in light of the continued growth of connected devices and the lack of security requirements for them. Hacker groups have claimed responsibility through Twitter, but those claims havent been verified and the pair says its likely that theyre all lying. Because the blueprints, or source code, for Mirai were public, an attack like this wouldnt need a governments resources. Researchers say Mirai has been used before, but not on the scale of Fridays attacks. The bad news: Using it isnt particularly hard and doesnt require much money. But when you bring it to Dyn, and a lot of the internet gets shut down, people take notice, Carlson said. Because the components were put into a variety of devices that were then packaged and rebranded, its hard to tell exactly where they ended up.",0,0

4784,"#160; So the Border Patrol has said itll wait to spray: The Border Patrol agreed to delay aerial spraying of the herbicide, which was set to begin Wednesday, until more talks were held with Mexican officials on the possible cross-border impact of such a project. The Feds plan (which, predictably, has drawn some Agent Orange comparisons) was to spray the cane with the herbicide Imazapyr, but not everyone is thrilled about that: A lawsuit accused the Department of Homeland Security of violating the National Environmental Policy Act regarding the now-delayed U.S. Border Patrol plans to conduct aerial spraying of an herbicide on carrizo (kah-DEE-zoh) cane near the Rio Grande. Since no one knows for sure how the herbicide would affect human health (let alone the 1,000 species in the ecosystem around the cane) Im hoping more testing happens before spray day. The latest addition to the Border Patrols most-wanted list isnt an illegal immigrant, but a plant. Well, okay, a plant that could conceal illegal immigrants, the Patrol fears. Luckily, that doesnt seem too hard: Earlier this month, about 70 students from Texas Aamp;M International University manually were able to clear about an acre of cane in fewer than three hours. Better yet, we could figure out how to eradicate the cane without chemicals. The plant in question is Carrizo cane, an invasive weed that grows in dense thickets along the border.

10804,"As the crisis intensifies, new details provided to Reuters by independent researchers and regulators, and previously unreported testimony by a company employee, demonstrate the unusual way Monsanto introduced its product. But it only supplied that data in finished form, Monsantos Carey told the Arkansas Plant Board meeting, meaning it withheld underlying data that could be analyzed independently by the regulators. The approach, in which Monsanto prevented key independent testing of its product, went unchallenged by the Environmental Protection Agency and nearly every state regulator. A meeting summary by the Arkansas Legislatures Joint Budget Committee described Careys testimony as follows: Boyd Carey is on record on Aug. 8 stating that the University of Arkansas nor any other university was given the opportunity to test VaporGrip in fear that the results may jeopardize the federal label. For instance, BASF, which introduced its rival herbicide, Engenia, around the same time, said it allowed several university researchers to evaluate its off-target impact and application parameters. As the system progressed and it got closer to EPA approval, the board kept asking for local data, Walker said. Monsanto Chief Technology Officer Robert Fraley said, We firmly believe that our product if applied according to the instructions on the label will not move off target and damage anyone. When samples are provided to researchers, lawyers hammer out contracts detailing how testing will be conducted and results will be handled, but rarely do agreements limit what the products can be tested for, according to researchers interviewed by Reuters. To help them do that, Monsanto shared its XtendiMax testing results with state regulators. But it would have given regulators a more complete picture of the formulas properties as they decided if and how to let farmers use it, agriculture experts said.

4076,"After the verdict, Jacksonville State Attorney Angela Corey said the use of deadly force is often one of the toughest areas of the law for prosecutors. Despite a clamoring by some for a conviction against George Zimmerman, jurors acquitted the former neighborhood watch leader of all charges, leaving many Americans to wonder how the justice system allowed him to walk away from the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. Jurors were told Zimmerman was allowed to use deadly force when he shot Martin not only if he faced actually faced death or bodily harm, but also if he merely thought he did. There is also little basis to charge Zimmerman with a federal hate crime, he said, since prosecutors would have to show that he killed Martin primarily because of the teens race. Even defense attorneys, who use the law to their advantage, say the instruction for the justifiable use of deadly force can be confusing to jurors since there are so many elements to it. ADVERTISEMENT Some Martin family supporters may never understand the gap between the legal basis for the jurys acquittal and what they perceived as the proper outcome: Zimmermans conviction for either second-degree murder or manslaughter. Part of the answer is found in the 27-page jury instructions on two matters: justifiable use of deadly force and reasonable doubt. Under Florida law, jurors were told to judge whether Zimmerman was justified in using deadly force by the circumstances he was under when he fired his gun. The danger facing George Zimmerman need not have been actual; however, to justify the use of deadly force, the appearance must have been so real that a reasonably cautious and prudent person would have believed the danger could be avoided only through the use of that force, the instruction read. Jurors were also told that reasonable doubt about Zimmermans guilt could come from conflicting evidence or the lack of evidence. Unlike the police officers in the King case, Zimmerman wasnt acting under color of law. And if they had any reasonable doubt on whether Zimmerman was justified in using deadly force, they should find him not guilty.",0,0

I sleep like a baby, he told the New York Times in 1998 when the reporter asked him to comment on the fact that one of the bombs he boasted about sending to Cuba had killed Fabio Di Celmo in the Copacabana Hotel in 1997. Judge Cardone stated that this information might prejudice the jury against Posada, since Santiago lvarez is Posadas financial benefactor, the owner of the boat that allegedly smuggled him into the United States and his co-conspirator in the cover-up of the smuggling operation. One of his defense attorneys, Felipe Milln, asked him if he felt all right. The FBI investigated, and as Abascal had told them, found C-4 plastic explosives, grenades and grenade launchers along with other illegal weapons, one of which was registered in the name of Posada Carriles principal benefactor and owner of the good ship Santrina, Santiago lvarez. Hernndez wants to be sure that the Great Wall of China surrounds that case, so the jury will never learn that some of the Santrinas crew, including the owner and captain of the boat that smuggled Posada into Miami, were convicted for possessing a large arms cache, including machine guns, silencers and grenade launchers in 2005, and that they negotiated a reduced sentence in 2007 after agreeing to surrender an additional 14 pounds of plastic explosives, 200 pounds of dynamite, 4,000 feet of detonator cord, 30 semiautomatic and automatic weapons, one grenade launcher and two handmade grenades.

The F-35 was already a tough sell in a post-Cold War world more interested in drones than manned aircraft.

The F-35 is the Pentagons most expensive weapons program at a total estimated cost of nearly $400 billion.

In November, California scientists tried editing a gene inside someones body for the first time, using a tool called zinc finger nucleases for a man with a metabolic disease. A NEW FRONTIER: GENE EDITING In mid-November, Brian Madeux, a 44-year-old Phoenix man with a metabolic disease called Hunter syndrome, had just become the first person to try an experimental gene editing treatment. Now, a series of jaw-dropping successes have renewed hopes that some one-time fixes of DNA, the chemical code that governs life, might turn out to be cures. ADVERTISEMENT The advent of gene editing a more precise and long-lasting way to do gene therapy may expand the number and types of diseases that can be treated. Tests of another editing tool called CRISPR, to genetically alter human cells in the lab, may start next year. The hope is that the gene and the editing tool would enter some of his liver cells and insert the instructions needed to start making an enzyme he lacks.

That rarity certainly shines through in the following six gold stats, which portray the vastness of the gold market before melting it down into a more personal context, showing the immense value gold packs into such a small space. In fact, not only are the country's reserves more than double those of the next largest gold-hoarding nation, Germany, but America also has more gold reserves than the next four largest holders of gold combined.

However, Graham said Wednesday he believes there may be a way to reach a deal between the DREAM Act and border security, but the president has to lead the effort in the House. When Republicans say we should not legalize people until we start addressing the fundamentals of a broken immigration system, they are not wrong, said Graham.

Russian Amnesty Bill May Free Pussy Riot and Greenpeace Members.In whats being seen as an attempt to assuage international outrage over human rights violations in Russia, the State Duma, the countrys lower parliament, unanimously passed a bill Wednesday that may allow prosecutors to drop charges on jailed protesters, just in time for the Sochi Olympics. As it stands, the amnesty is expected to cover about 2,000 convicts less than 2 percent of Russias prison population, said Valentin Gefter, director of the Institute of Human Rights. Maria Arkhipova, a member of the May 6 citizens group founded to support the detainees said that the amnesty was an opportunity for the Russian authorities to correct their mistakes but that it was premature to discuss the possibility of a pardon. Critics of the case say that the charges, which could carry prison sentences of up to 13 years, have been fabricated by law-enforcement officials to stifle the Russian protest movement. In planning the amnesty, the authorities had to balance two competing goals: placating critics who consider Russias penitentiary system too harsh and mollifying the overwhelming majority of the population that advocates tough punishments for crime and regrets the abolition of the death penalty. According to The Washington Post: Separate amendments to the amnesty bill could spell reprieve for some of the 27 Russian citizens including 12 currently on trial who have been charged with participating in mass riots that erupted at an anti-government rally on the eve of Putins inauguration to a third term as president last year.

The quinoa and mango side dish served with the salmon was exceptional: light, fresh, tasty and creative. According to the menu, the chile relleno that came with the steak was stuffed with cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, but ours had bland, unseasoned potatoes that needed a makeover, especially considering the mildness of the chile itself.

9523,"One key issue before the justices is whether profit-making corporations may assert religious beliefs under the 1993 religious freedom law or the First Amendment provision guaranteeing Americans the right to believe and worship as they choose. (Charles Dharapak/The Associated Press) WASHINGTON - Seemingly divided, the Supreme Court struggled Tuesday with the question of whether companies have religious rights, a case challenging President Barack Obama's health overhaul and its guarantee of birth control in employees' preventive care plans. But the justices still would have to decide whether the birth control requirement impinges on religious freedom and, if so, whether the government makes a persuasive case that the policy is important and has been put in place in the least objectionable way possible. Clement acknowledged that courts would have to decide on a case-by-case basis, but he said only the kind of family-owned companies he represented would make such claims, not large, multinational corporations. The Obama administration says it's not just about birth control, that a Supreme Court ruling in favor of the businesses also could undermine laws governing immunizations, Social Security taxes and minimum wages. Roberts at one point suggested that the court could limit its ruling to just such companies. The family-owned companies that are challenging the provision provide health insurance to their employees but object to covering certain methods of birth control that they say can work after conception, in violation of their religious beliefs. The justices upheld the overall health care law two years ago in a 5-4 ruling in which Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote in favor of Obama's signature domestic legislation. The outcome could turn on the views of Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the decisive vote, as his colleagues appeared otherwise to divide along liberal and conservative lines. The latest case focuses on a sliver of the law dealing with preventive services, including contraception, that must be offered in a company's plan at no extra charge. The court could skirt that issue by finding that the individuals who own the businesses have the right to object.

Exhibiting his habitual moral refinement, Dershowitz also an advocate of judge-sanctioned torture here in the US argued that the same level of deterrence could be achieved by leveling the villages of suicide bombers after the residents had been given a chance to evacuate. USA Today (which has the advantage of being a Friedman-free zone) ran an exciting graphic put together by the Federation of American Scientists displaying the long term effects of ten pounds of TNT wrapped around a pea-size piece of cesium 137 from a medical gauge being exploded at the National Gallery of Art. Dershowitz Says Baby Killing Plan Legitimate But Flawed Nathan Lewin, a bigtime attorney in Washington DC, often tipped for a federal judgeship and legal advisor to several Orthodox organizations, told Forward, as reported there on June 7, 2002, that the families of suicide bombers should be executed, arguing that such a policy would offer the necessary deterrent against suicide attacks. It turned out Muhajir had ten grand in cash and maybe big dreams but nothing in the way of radioactive dirt or even TNT. This is the Terrorism of Everyday Life, at the most elemental level, aimed at the weakest in our midst: no money for food, for shelter, for the kids, and a President who actually wants to stiffen the work requirements.

13933,"With attempts to put an international price on carbon proving politically impossible, Neilson believes it is time for the worlds superpowers to push the process forward by imposing border taxes on carbon. Neilson, who in 2008 was instrumental in setting up the New Zealand emissions trading scheme the first national carbon trading regime outside Europe says drastic measures are now needed as time to prevent catastrophic climate change is rapidly running out. By introducing the carbon tax, he says, all countries would then be encouraged to start pricing in climate-changing carbon emissions in their products in order to protect their traders. Under the current system, any country that moves first on taxing carbon in its products also risks putting its exporters at a price disadvantage. Imposing a market price on carbon emissions has been repeatedly put forward as a key way of tackling climate change. For a global agreement to cap and then reduce emissions to work, almost every country needs to agree to take responsibility for a share of the globally reducing cap and live with the consequences of eventually lowering its own domestic emissions level, or paying someone else to reduce theirs, he says. The producers may threaten to relocate their production to a country that has not imposed a price on carbon; this is called the carbon leakage problem. International Trade Tax Could Help Cut Carbon Emissions.By Adelia Hallett / Climate News Network #160; #160; Imported products such as rice could be subject to a carbon tax. Peter Neilson, an economist who served as minister of revenue and customs in the 1980s, puts forward the idea in a study of carbon pricing and international trade. Neilson points out big countries dont want to be the first to act, in case they end up paying the full costs of tackling climate change, while small countries know they cant fix the problem on their own, and so are waiting for large countries to move first. But carbon trading schemes such as the EUs Emissions Trading System, the worlds biggest have so far failed to make any serious contribution to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. It would mean that if China, for example, includes rice in its emissions trading scheme, any rice it then imports and which had not been subject",1,1

WASHINGTON Senate Republicans steered toward a potential showdown vote on their long-awaited health care bill next week, despite indications that theyve yet to solidify the 50 GOP votes theyll need to avert an embarrassing defeat. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said the Republican plan does not yet do enough to reduce premiums, a key GOP goal, and said it needed to go further in easing the coverage requirements Obamas law imposes on insurers. Though a member of the 13-senator working group McConnell had tasked with piecing legislation together, Lee said hes not seen the emerging bill and whole-heartedly shares the frustration of constituents unhappy over the secrecy. ADVERTISEMENT But later, he simply chortled when asked if he was confident the measure would pass, a victory that would elude him if just three of the 52 GOP senators voted no. McConnells ability to assess and line up votes is considered masterful, and hes eager to pass legislation fulfilling a keystone campaign promise of President Donald Trump and countless GOP congressional candidates. A loss would be a major blow for Trump and congressional Republicans, but it would let GOP senators take a definitive stance on the issue and let Republicans move on to other priorities like tax cuts. ADVERTISEMENT Though McConnell did not schedule the vote for next week, some Republicans said they believed he would hold it either way. 3 Senate GOP leader, John Thune of South Dakota, said Republicans were moving toward phasing out Obamas enlargement of Medicaid to additional low-income people over five or six years.

Twitter threatens huge crackdown on abusive trolls.If youre one of those people who uses Twitter to be abusive and harass other people, Twitter has its eye on you and you could find yourself completely locked out. The social media giant has introduced an enforcement option that will allow its team to lock out abusive Twitter accounts for a certain period of time, or at least ask a user to confirm a phone number and then delete offending tweets, according to an Inquirer report. Its the latest in a series of steps that Twitter has made in order to improve the safety and security of its service, following on the heels of an effort last year known as Get Safe Online that updated anti-harassment tools and made it easier for users to report abuse. Twitter is trying to crack down on situations where multiple users harass a person or group of people, or just users who employ violent threats to attack people they dont like. The move follows one of the more high-profile cases of Twitter abuse: an effort to get Jane Austen immortalized on the UKs 10 note by Caroline Criado Perez, who was targeted by a man and a woman who allegedly sent 50 abusive tweets an hour for 12 hours, which ended up landing both of them in jail.

509,"He said its easy to see why our pets would love us: The success of dogs (and other domesticated creatures) on the surface of the Earth is entirely due to the fact that we take some level of care of them. Wynne thinks its likely that the animals started out as wolves that scavenged from human garbage pits; those willing to get closer to people got more food, and they evolved to become tamer over time. For another, Wynne noted, dogs and cats really arent that useful anymore. Hed like to see more and better data perhaps an experiment that examined brain scans of people taken while they looked at cats and dogs. Wynne noted that domesticated dogs are very childlike: They exhibit several behaviors usually found only among juveniles in wild animals, such as licking (or kissing) their owners faces, and theyre unable to survive on their own. Eventually, humans felt comfortable around dogs and dogs liked being around us enough that we took them into our homes and recruited them for our hunts. As a scientist, Wynne isnt happy with any of the theories put forward to explain our love for our pets. You get dog burials, which show there was a lot of care and attention paid to the burial, Wynne said, and they include grave goods (valuable items placed in the grave for use in the afterlife), which really seems like there was a strong indication of affection. Then people got involved, selectively breeding the cutest, cuddliest and most cooperative creatures until we got the pets we know today. But he acknowledged theres no satisfying evolutionary explanation for that warm, gooey feeling we get when we look at our dogs and cats. But even then, its not clear that we loved dogs, Wynne said. For one thing, domesticated livestock are also useful, but we typically dont name cows or cry over movies about sheep that find their way home.",0,0

Its not clear whether ministers will agree on the new draft,or what that draft will even look like.

Its call for a path forward was rather vague, with a stated goal of launching a process in order to develop a legal framework at some unspecified point after 2020.

In the short term, there's a good chance Volaris' solid unit revenue and margin growth trajectory will drive continued outperformance for its stock relative to other airline stocks. Spirit Airlines stock also trades for far less than its typical revenue multiple, which makes the stock a great bargain for long-term investors. Spirit Airlines is a better valueSpirit Airlines and Volaris both have huge upside due to their massive growth opportunities, and I own shares of both companies. In the long run, Spirit and Volaris are likely to have comparable profit margins and growth rates. Diverging performanceOver the past two years, the share prices of Spirit Airlines and Volaris have tended to move in opposite directions. Spirit was the worst-hit as larger rivals started to match its low fares to keep their planes full. Additionally, the Mexican air travel market is still maturing, so a lot of Volaris' growth will come from adding more flights on existing routes. And the company believes it could earn a 15% or higher operating margin in more than 500 markets beyond the roughly 190 it serves today. During 2015, Spirit's profit margin continued to rise despite its weak unit revenue performance because of the impact of lower fuel prices. For the full year, total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) increased 9%, while unit costs declined 4.6% thanks to lower fuel prices. It would take more than a decade of double-digit growth for Spirit to capitalize on all of these opportunities.",1,3

Filing taxes electronically is a good way to avoid mistakes on your taxes and, just as important, get your hands on your refund as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you file a paper tax return, it could take anywhere from six to eight weeks to get your money back -- that's almost the double the wait. For example, if you owe money on your taxes and file early to get your return off your plate, you can set up an automatic payment for any day up until the April 15 deadline. One final reason to file your taxes electronically this year is that you're likely to save yourself time, aggravation, and stress. While you may be used to paper, consider these three benefits of filing taxes electronically when you sit down to tackle your next return. If you're wondering how to e-file your federal tax return, it's a simple matter of going online and either using commercial software or taking advantage of the IRS Free File Opens a New Window.

9819,"), heres how many extra votes each income level would receive: In this scenario, the 500,000 or so Americans earning $1 million or more would get 3.9 million extra votes, effectively increasing their voting power by 700 percent. In fact, under graduated suffrage, Romney would get 52 percent of the 1.8 billion votes castessentially the mirror image of Obamas actual win. The 10-percenters are enough of a minority that their overall share of the total vote didnt change much under the one-millionaire-seven-votes system. And it wouldnt be the superwealthy that carry the election for him, but the well-off voters in the $50,000 to $100,000 bracket, who received the lions share of extra votes based on income. How would officially stacking the deck in favor of the superwealthy change a system where they already wield disproportionate influence"" Would it upend partisan politics as we know it"" First, lets look at how Americans voted in the 2012 presidential race based on income. So, if Hunts system of graduated suffrage was in place, would it have boosted the electoral power of Romneys older, richer constituency enough to flip the election? Beyond that, citizens may earn premium votes, based on how much they pay in taxes: Assuming that the Alpacas tax system works like ours, the top 10 percent of taxpayers likely would be the wealthiest 10 percent of citizens. Even though voters making $50,000 or more and voters over 40 made up nearly 60 percent of the electorate, respectively, Obama won with 52 percent of the overall vote. But the share of the Romney-leaning folks with above-average incomes jumped considerablyfrom less than a third of total votes in 2012 to more than half in the hypothetical election. Voters between 22 and 65 automatically get two votes apiece; young and elderly voters get one vote. *A couple of things I did not try to include in my calculations: In Alpaca, corporate taxes are also counted toward ones total tax bill, so its possible that the final distribution of votes is more concentrated toward the very top.",1,1

While Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have feuded before and since the failed health care vote in July, there was little talk in Nashville of dumping the veteran Kentucky senator as leader. The sentiment reflects a difference between RNC leaders concerned about the partys image in light of President Donald Trumps latest rhetorical thicket and newer, more ardently pro-Trump state Republican leaders who say such a statement appears defensive. RNC Votes to Condemn White Supremacists.NASHVILLE, Tenn.The Republican National Committee walked the tightrope Friday in carefully but resolutely denouncing white supremacist groups without criticizing President Donald Trump, who waffled in his own statements in the wake of the deadly clash in Virginia this month. Trumps intraparty attacks have some GOP strategists worried that the fighting could harm Republicans chances of holding the Senate in next years midterm elections, though that would require Democrats to retain almost all of the 10 seats they occupy in states Trump won last year. But this was a priority for Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, as well as for committee members who were openly bothered by Trumps initial resistance to singling out the racist groups after the Charlottesville violence.

10932,"When you work from home, you not only limit your contact with other people at your company, but you also create a situation where you're less likely to get to know your colleagues on a personal level -- which could also affect your relationships. Since working from home isn't all roses, rather than take the plunge full-time, you might think about telecommuting on a part-time basis and working in an actual office the rest of the week. Whether you're thinking of doing so on occasion or want to permanently give up your cubicle in favor of a home office Opens a New Window., here are a few distinct drawbacks to be aware of. Granted, not everyone who works from home will struggle to convince the rest of the world that he or she has a real, legitimate job, but it's a pitfall to be aware of nonetheless. One lesser-known drawback of working from home boils down to perception -- that you're a person of leisure during the day because you don't have a boss looking over your shoulder. If your boss needs to delegate a huge amount of responsibility on the fly, but you're not physically present when he or she looks around the room, you could end up losing out big time. Unless you're a truly disciplined worker by nature, you may come to find that telecommuting actually hurts your career by making you less productive. So if you're the one person on your team who isn't always available for on-the-spot, impromptu meetings, there's a good chance your coworkers will inevitably wind up hashing things out without you. Working from home certainly has its share of benefits, so much so that workers are 87% more likely to love their jobs if they're able to telecommute. These days, a growing number of companies are offering employees the opportunity to work remotely, either on a part-time or full-time basis.

The latter, designed exclusively for Altria and Colombia's Santo Domingo family who together own about 41 percent of SABMiller, had been worth less than the all-cash option last year, but with the fall of sterling and a rise of AB InBev shares, had surpassed it since. Anheuser-Busch InBev raised its $100 billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller on Tuesday after a slide in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote made the offer less attractive for many investors, threatening to derail the deal. The changes come after a number of activist investors, such as Elliott, bought stakes in SABMiller and several shareholders voiced concerns at least week's annual general meeting that the cash deal was less attractive for many investors than before and, in any case, below the share-and-cash alternative. Continue Reading Below SABMiller said its chairman had talked with his counterpart at AB InBev on Friday about the offer in the light of exchange rate volatility and market movements. It has also tweaked the terms of an alternative share-and-cash structure designed for SABMiller's two largest shareholders, raising the cash element by 88 pence a share. In November, when the original bid was officially launched, it was worth around 70 billion pounds, or $106 billion based on exchange rates at the time.

AB InBev, which has hedged to cover the pounds initially required, said the revised terms were final.

9333,"But Corrections spokeswoman Alex Tomlin strongly denied all the claims in the lawsuit and said prison logs show Hinzo often refuses to take showers and regularly has access to medical care. In recent years, several states, including Maine, Colorado and California, have begun looking at their prison-isolation policies after advocates and lawyers have publicized alleged abuse cases and wrote reports detailing the high incidence of inmate isolation, particularly among the mentally ill. For example, the states prison system has adopted a strict log policy to monitor inmates activities while in solitary confinement and has introduced a number of programs aimed at preparing inmates for life after prison. In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque against New Mexico Department of Corrections Secretary Gregg Marcantel and other staffers, a lawyer for Justin Hinzo says the 39-year-old prisoner is trapped in windowless cell at the Penitentiary of New Mexico near Santa Fe and is deteriorating mentally because of the conditions. She said the lawsuit also falsely says Marcantel was questioned about inhumane conditions after going on the CBS program Undercover Boss. In fact, Tomlin said Hinzo is kept in a cell with a window and regularly is given a chance to leave isolation. The lawsuit comes at a time when the New Mexico Department of Corrections has adopted a number of reforms aimed at improving conditions for inmates. Hinzo is serving 28 years in prison for the shooting death of Dean Montano and the wounding of another man in November 2002 after a fight at a trailer park. The lawsuit claims that those conditions and neglect left Hinzo with post-traumatic stress disorder and that he has been permanently damaged by the infliction of long-term solitary confinement. He went on (ABCs) Nightline, and it was after he volunteered to spend 48 hours in solitary confinement, she said. The sentence was enhanced because Hinzo has prior convictions and because he used a weapon as a felon.

In fact, the Plan places the onus of the drug war on Mexico and includes no counterpart measures to reduce the U.S. market, improve customs control on the northern side of the border, reduce retailing and distribution, eliminate illegal arms traffic, and prosecute money-launderingall problems located firmly within the United States. A 2004 report documents the impact of increased U.S. military aid in Latin America and concludes that Too often in Latin America, when armies have focused on an internal enemy, the definition of enemies has included political opponents of the regime in power, even those working within the political system such as activists, independent journalists, labor organizers, or opposition political-party leaders. In addition to doubts about the efficacy of the war on drugs model for eliminating traffic in illegal drugs, one of the strongest and most frequent criticisms relates to the poor human rights record and corruption of the Mexican security forces that would directly receive the aid. Moreover, although President Calderon has heralded the measure as an example that the U.S. government is willing to assume its part in fighting the illegal drug trade and rise in organized crime, the bulk of the budget for the initiative will never make it to Mexico. While international cooperation to confront terrorism is a laudable and necessary aim, the Bush national security strategy 5 entails serious violations of national sovereignty for its partner countries, increased risk of being targeted as U.S. military allies, and threats to civil liberties for citizens in all three countries. The total aid to Colombias government continues to be huge and largely military, but along with the likely rejection of the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia due to human and labor rights concerns, it marks a minimal recognition in Congress that the drug war model in that nation is simply not working as intended.

12057,"It is far more productive to talk about ways to use market mechanisms to fundamentally restructure the health care system than to try to scrape together nickels and dimes in tax revenue to pay to maintain a broken health care system for a few more years. Given the enormous gap in costs for health care services between the United States and Europe, not to mention high-quality facilities in places like India and Thailand, there would likely be a huge flow of patients for treatment outside the country, if we created the proper institutional structure. If progressives accept the structures put in place by conservatives as the free market and then look to use tax and transfer policy to redress the inequities, we have given ourselves a hopeless task. Of course, it would be much better to reform the system in the United States so that people did not have to leave the country to get decent affordable care. In fact, since these countries would be getting a premium above their cost of care, this could be a major source of growth for these countries. To take another example, the government grants pharmaceutical companies patent monopolies that allow them to mark up the price of prescription drugs by several hundred percent or even several thousand percent above what the same drugs would sell for in a competitive market. By reducing demand for health care in the United States, it would also lead to downward pressure on domestic medical costs more generally. After the forces of market competition have worked their magic, we will be much better able to discuss reform with the domestic health care industry. Easing professional and immigration restrictions that largely protect the most highly educated workers from international competition will reduce pay for those in the top 1 percent to 2 percent of the wage distribution and help to lower the cost of everything from health care to a college education. The demands of the financial industry on government are not qualitatively different from what other sectors get as a result of government interventions in structuring the market. A serious long-term progressive agenda must move away from a focus on tax-and-transfer policy and instead concentrate on changing the rules that lead to undesirable market outcomes. As our moral philosophers labor over this problem, consider that the drug would probably cost $200 a year in the absence of patent protection.",1,1

Thanks, -- Bill Benefits Dear Bill, Performing an individual retirement account rollover from a former employer's 401(k) plan can give you wider investment choices and potentially reduced annual fees and other expenses. You also have the option to convert to a Roth IRA, which allows you to pay income taxes upfront and to take qualified distributions tax-free once you retire. This option typically works best if you pay the tax bill from funds other than those held in the 401(k). The 401(k)-to-Roth-IRA conversion would be used if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket now than when you start tapping retirement funds. If you move the 401(k) account funds to an IRA brokerage account, you'd be able to invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. I've kept money with previous employers to gain access to mutual funds that I wouldn't be able to invest in on my own in an individual retirement account.

Scalia, who Garland would replace, wrote the opinion, which holds that the prohibition violates the Second Amendments protection of the right for private individuals to own firearms. The court #160;including Garland #160; upheld the lower courts ruling: We see no basis for concluding that auditing the [National Instant Criminal Background Check System] would suddenly produce constitutional violations. While the the government insisted the records, which were kept for a period of six months, were used for auditing purposes, the NRA claimed they were the first steps towards a national gun registry. Garlands most recent decision involving firearms happens to relate to the most important gun case in U.S. history. #160;#160; The next year, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts decision, which invalidated the handgun ban, on a 5-4 vote.

In light of these two cases, the National Review wrote last week that Garlands decisions mean that he is not the political moderate that many have asserted and that he would try to overturn Heller.

Commenting upon the fact that an awful lot of people were getting multiple registration cards that would permit them to vote more than once, Mr. Karzai said: We are just beginning an exercise; people are enthusiastic, they want to have cards. According to one report, not all holders of more than one registration card intend to vote repeatedly. When the election date was first announced there was concern that the Taliban would intimidate would-be voters and that conservatives would discourage women from registering to vote. The enthusiasm over the success of the Afghan experiment in democracy was not dampened when it was pointed out that the 9.9 million registered voters came out of a voting population estimated to contain 9.5 million people. Given the events of 2000, nothing is of greater concern to the citizenry than that this election be unblemished by the sorts of irregularities that caused the president in the last election to be selected by 9 people in black robes.

Just as importantly, the group of forward-looking, largely datacentric solutions that include its Watson supercomputer, now account for 35% of IBM's total sales. At first glance, it may not seem as though tech leaders IBM and Intel have much in common, other than sharing the same industry. The latest in IBM's string of $5 billion-plus in recent deals is for Salesforce.com consulting partner Bluewolf, and will bolster its efforts in the estimated $111 billion professional services market, delivered via the cloud. The case for IBMIn what has become a recurring theme, IBM announced yet another acquisition to boost its cloud solutions reach. IBM CEO Ginni Rometty's focus on its strategic imperatives, which includes the cloud, IoT, cognitive computing, big data, and business analytics, is in full swing.

Bringing these far-flung teachers together on a common goal can be difficultharder, say, than in one major urban area like New York or Chicago, where the same policies are being imposed on the entire union. Dowgiert notes that despite anti-union rhetoric from those who say they want to improve schools, Massachusetts teachers are among the most heavily unionized in the country, and the states' schools are consistently rated the best in the nation. Administrators, she says, assume that the lower-income parents in Holyoke are not involved with their kids' schooling and won't challenge school practices, but they got a surprise when parents and teachers spoke together at the school committee meeting. Arguing that he never intended the boards to be public, Paez said during the meeting, ""I'm asking teachers to do hundreds of things, but I'm not asking them to humiliate kids It's not whatsoever a directive from this administration to do this.""

Kaeppel, who was one of Madeloni's students at UMass, says that it seemed like a winnable fight to the Holyoke EDU members and their supporters from outside of the district, and has served to catalyze some parent support. Stein points out that nationwide, and certainly in Massachusetts, neoliberal education reform has involved attempts to blame unions for students' struggles and to make it easier to fire teachers.

He said he would enforce existing laws ""perhaps with a lot more energy"" and ""get rid of all the bad ones,"" citing President Obama's own record of deporting undocumented immigrants as a model. Pacheco recalled that Trump seemed to have a weak grasp on the issues he seemed to believe they were undocumented by choice before they explained there was no clear way for them to earn legal status, a problem they hoped to address through legislation. Like Trumps call to punish women who have an abortion, which he retracted after realizing pro-life groups opposed to the concept, he seemed to be telling hardliners what he thought they wanted to hear rather than what anyone had demanded. As late as August 2013, Trump told NBC News Kasie Hunt he wasnt sure about his position on the recently passed Gang of Eight bill or whether he might support portions of it. To be determined, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN when asked whether Trump still favored a new deportation force to remove undocumented immigrants. In the same NBC News interview in which he pledged to deport DREAMers brought to America as children, he said he would bring them back rapidly, the good ones after the deportations were complete. Trump set off a wave of speculation after he met with Hispanic supporters on Saturday, some of whom came away hopeful he might soften his opposition on legalizing undocumented immigrants. For conservatives, the primary alternative to legalization when Trump entered the race was self-deportation, a strategy put forward by Mitt Romney in 2012 that would encourage immigrants to leave on their own by restricting their access to work, transportation, and housing. Trump cannon-balled into this carefully worded debate in 2015 with a series of confusing statements and outrageous boasts that went far beyond what even the most ardent anti-immigrant politicians had proposed.

Saudi Arabia which introduced the ban in 2013 and its Gulf Arab neighbours have been wary of secure internet communication, which experts say is harder to monitor, especially by activists and militants. Access to VoIP (voice over internet protocol) will reduce operational costs and spur digital entrepreneurship thats why it is such an important step in the Kingdoms internet regulation, it said. Saudi Arabia to lift ban on internet calls.RIYADH (Reuters) Saudi Arabia will lift a ban on internet phone calls, a government spokesman said, part of efforts to attract more business to the country. The Saudi authorities will continue to regulate the Internet to restrict content that violates the countrys laws such as extremist material, pornography and gambling sites, the information ministry said. The policy reversal represents part of the Saudi governments broad reforms to diversify the economy partly in response to low oil prices, which have hit the countrys finances.

Its the normal length of time for an El Nio to last, so exactly how this plays out in the next few months, given that it's already beginning to fade a little bit, will be interesting to see but often some of the biggest effects do occur around February across North America, Trenberth cautions. In some sense, what we're seeing around the world right now is an advanced view of the sort of things that we'll see more of in the future all of the weather systems being somewhat more vigorous than they have been in the past, the risk of both droughts in some regions and flooding in other regions, says climate scientist Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Whats more, changes in ocean temperature become amplified over dry land, according to one study. Changing weather patterns also brought a major drought to Indonesia, with a tremendous number of wildfires, while here in the US, major flooding occurred along the Mississippi River, especially in the state of Missouri. Trenberth believes the current El Nio may have peaked in November in terms of the magnitude of the unusual sea surface temperatures out in the tropical Pacific, so its effects may begin to subside soon. This would have been a good time to have mechanisms in place to capture all of this years extra rain or to plan for the increased risk of wildfire in Australia, Trenberth says.

Burrs win cements continued Republican leadership in the state, where the GOP has dominated the state House and Senate since 2010. Outside groups, including the National Rifle Association and the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super-PAC, have poured more than $50 million into the campaign, making it one of the most expensive senate races in the states history.

8654,"Far from seeing the virtual reality game as a potential lure to houses of worship, the Saudi Muslim clerics issued a fatwa, or directive, renewing its 15-year opposition to the Pokmon game franchise. The Reuters report noted that Middle Eastern countries are often worried about the growth of social media and authorities in Kuwait and Egypt have already warned that players might be tempted to point their smartphones at restricted locations such as royal palaces, mosques, oil facilities or military bases. (Photo/Youtube) While many U.S. Christians see the app-based game as a way of bringing Millennials into their churches, the Saudi council sees the game as blasphemous because its characters mutate. The fatwa also noted that symbolism in the game derives from religions like Shinto and Christianity, as well as from Freemasonry and global Zionism, Reuters reported. It also said the game contained other elements prohibited by Islamic law, including polytheism against God by multiplying the number of deities, and gambling, which God has forbidden in the Quran and likened to wine and idols, the news agency report said. The General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars said it had revived a 2001 decree against a Pokmon card game in response to queries from believers, the news agency reported.

While she has indeed spoken about gender and sexual rights with considerable frequency, and while she may not share the overtly misogynistic and anti-LGBT views of most Republican politicians, as a policymaker she has consistently favored policies devastating to women and LGBT persons. Hillary Clinton’s Empowerment.Assuming Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016, much of her popular support will be based on her image as an advocate of womens rights. We suggest that feminist enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is reflective of a profound crisis of US liberal feminism, which has long embraced or accepted capitalism, racism, empire, and even heterosexism and transphobia. A group of 250 academics and activists calling themselves Feminists for Clinton praised her powerful, inspiring advocacy of the human rights of women and her enormous contributions as a policymaker. Clinton and supporters have recently stepped up efforts to portray her as a champion of both womens and LGBT rights. Part of the answer surely lies in the barrage of sexist attacks that have targeted her and the understandable desire of many feminists to see a woman in the Oval Office. Since then, NOW and other mainstream womens organizations have been eagerly#160; anticipating her 2016 candidacy. Such depictions have little basis in Clintons past performance.

Yet the Buckeye State reversed course and 17-year-olds will no longer be able to vote in the states presidential primary on March 15. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husteds directive, in the 2015 election manual, states that these young voters cannot vote because the presidential primary election being held on March 15 will elect delegates, who then go to the conventions of their parties to vote on a nominee. I was astonished to learn that 17-year-old Ohioans who will legally become adults before the November election are now being prohibited from having a say in the direction of their country at the presidential ballot box during the primary. In 2008, Husteds predecessor Jennifer Brunner confirmed that 17-year-olds could just nominate candidates, but did not say how presidential primaries were categorized. Less than half of all states allow 17-year-olds to vote in primaries and caucuses if they will be 18 by the date of the general election. Then-candidate Barack Obama targeted 17-year-old voters in 2008s primary race against Clintonincluding in Ohio. Clyde asserted that the young voters have been able to participate in the states primary for decades. Last month, New Mexico changed its law to allow 17-year-olds to vote in its primary election this year. Last year, Ohio students sued Husted for his efforts to restrict voting.

The Saudis began their campaign Nov. 4 after Houthi fighters entered Saudi border villages and attacked a border patrol, killing one guard and wounding 11 others, according to the official Saudi account. It is not clear how intense the ground fighting still is, but Saudi assistant defense minister Prince Khaled bin Sultan, who denounced the Houthis for giving allegiance to other countries, told his troops Nov. 10 that the offensive would continue until the Houthis retreat tens of kilometres [miles] inside their border,"" Agence France Presse reported. Analysts say that Saudi Arabia also wants to signal Tehran that it will not tolerate Iranian interference in Yemen, which would open up a new front in the sectarian and regional rivalry between Shiite Iran and Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia. They dispute the Saudi version of how the current conflict began, claiming that they came under fire from the Saudis who were helping Yemeni government troops against the rebels. Last week, Irans Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki denied that Iran is supporting the Houthis and, without naming it, warned Saudi Arabia to stay out of Yemen. But an unidentified Saudi government advisor told news agencies that the Saudi air force was bombing Houthi rebel camps inside Yemen. The Iranian card is still murky because we have no real, independent, confirmed evidence of Iranian government aid to the Houthi rebels, said Theodore Karasik, director of research and development at the Dubai-based Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA). According to the Gulf States Newsletter, the Saudi government has been supporting the Yemens most recent push against the rebels, which started in August, with intelligence and about $1.2 million a month.

After some 30 years of making bail-out and structural adjustment loans to indebted and impoverished countries in return for their adherence to a long list of neo-liberal economic reformstrade and investment deregulation, privatization, tightening access to credit, and rapid budget cuts and public-sector layoffs, to name a fewthe IMF has been confronting a crisis of confidence for the past two years. Poor Record So it can hardly have been welcome news for Mr. Rato and his colleagues in IMF management to have two high-profile reports released in the last two months, one from a commission jointly appointed by the IMF and the World Bank and the other from the IMFs own internal watchdog, slamming its record in low-income countries, and Africa in particular. With all these early repayments, and the gathering certainty that virtually no middle-income countries would be giving the IMF more business, it soon appeared that the IMF might face a crisis of solvency. Less diplomatic than the Brazilians, Argentine President Nestor Kirchner made it clear that he saw the move as an emancipation from the suffocating conditions imposed for decades by the IMF. With the new function that mollified the official critics apparently a non-starter, it seems only logical to assume that hand-wringing about the relevance and future of the IMF will return to dominate conversations at the meetings. Large chunks of increased aid flows often as much as 85% in countries that have inflation rates above 5% (an extremely low figure for countries that need to spur rapid growth) are, on IMF orders, not spent, but instead added to the countrys international reserves, where they avail no poor people of better health care or education.

7946,"Bernie Sanders became the first socialist mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and ran successfully as an Independent for the House of Representatives and then the Senate. In Washington, Sanders caucused with the Democrats, but didnt win many friends among them when he called Congress impotent and said he wouldnt mind if 80 percent of its members lost their bids for re-election. The Brooklyn-born Sanders launched his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination from Burlington in May 2015, joining a small field that was led by Hillary Clinton. In 2012, Sanders suggested that hed be open to seeing a primary challenger to Barack Obama to move the president to the left. The following year, Sanders got an amendment into the Dodd-Frank financial reform law to audit the loansthe Fed made to banks during the emergency. Sanders was elected to the House of Representatives by a 17-point margin in 1990, after Vermont Democrats either endorsed him or stepped aside to clear his path. In the wake of the financial crisis, he tried to hold up the re-nomination of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in 2009, saying he was one of the key architects of the Bush economy. But when he ran as an Independent for mayor of Burlington in 1981, the socialist Sanders beat the five-term Democratic incumbent. Sanders, whose call for free tuition at public colleges is a campaign centerpiece, ran into skepticism about how he would pay for such a program. As mayor, Sanders clashed with Burlingtons Board of Aldermen, which didnt allow him to hire his own staff and went so far as to fire his secretary. While Sanders was in Congress, his wife Jane Sanders led Burlington College, a small private liberal arts school in Vermont, from 2004 to 2011. But the 1982 election helped turn the tide towards Sanders, giving him a majority on the board that could sustain a veto (he used it twice in 1982).",1,1

Nikolai Vitti says public education is a constitutional right, and all 130,000 students in Duval Countys public schools deserve second, even third chances. However, the school districts superintendent Nikolai Vitti and an appellate court disagreed with Davis, and the bully may be back in school Monday. As the case progressed through the juvenile court, Florida circuit Judge Henry Davis ruled the bully girl was banned from attending any public school in the entire county. CBS News reported the attacker apparently has quite the collection of other videotaped beatings of students, but according to Jewett, school officials never did anything about the bully. The injunction is a permanent injunction barring this child from returning to any public school in Duval County, Davis ruled, according to CBS. According to the CBS interview: I dont think we should use the bad decisions children make outside of schools as an example or scapegoat to make a message, Vitti said. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools that allows students to obtain a high quality education and for the establishment, maintenance, and operation of institutions of higher learning and other public education programs that the needs of the people may require [Emphasis added].

Hassan Ghani So despite boasting the support of millions, has the anti-war movement essentially failed in its objectives of stopping war, or even affecting change in foreign policy.

But Tony Blair still took this country to war on whats now apparent was flawed, or even fraudulent, intelligence. We can instead be a force for moral good in the world by respecting international law and seeking to relate to people rather than the way weve increasingly got involved in wars largely on behalf of the United States. Tariq Ali, Writer / Filmmaker It pains me when good people, especially in the United States, who were hostile to wars when Bush was waging them, become passive when Obama wages them. Hassan Ghani There were also calls to do more to counter the increasing use of drone attacks, which often result in substantial civilian deaths, a tactic which anti-war campaigners argue is counter-productive, and will ultimately increase the risk of terrorism at home. Hassan Ghani Today, in a more complex world, and with a so called war on terror that has spread to many more fronts, Britains anti-war movement is taking stock. I think Western foreign policy is something most British people are actually concerned about, and they do oppose those interventions, including the occupation of Afghanistan. Like millions of others across the world, the British public said no to the invasion of Iraq. Hassan Ghani It is true however, that while there is no public appetite for further wars abroad, and opposition to Britains ongoing military action in Afghanistan has grown, the numbers at public protests have shrunk in recent years",1,1

Continue Reading Below The company said data collected by the millions of Fitbit trackers in use show that people are averaging less than seven hours of sleep a night, the amount recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One of Fitbit's chief competitors, the Apple Watch, doesn't come with sleep tracking, as it needs a nightly recharge. For example, if you get more sleep on weekends, Fitbit might suggest that you're not getting enough during the week. Ultimately, Fitbit hopes to personalize recommendations on how much sleep you need rather than rely on general guidelines from studies, said Shelten Yuen, Fitbit's vice president of research and development. Fitbits already track how much sleep people get and use sensors to measure periods of being awake or restless while in bed.

Pushing capabilities beyond exercise could help Fitbit appeal to people whose fitness routines are already stable. So Fitbit will offer deeper sleep tracking on some of its devices.

3213,"One of the biggest arguments against the fiduciary rule is that it could unfairly impact smaller and independent retirement advisors, who might not have the ability to afford the costs of complying with the new regulations. The point of the fiduciary rule is to ensure that retirement planners and other related professionals will be legally obligated to put their clients' best interest first -- not just to find investments that meets the clients' objectives. One of the biggest benefits to hiring a fiduciary to handle your investments and other assets is that a fiduciary must put his or her client's best interest ahead of their own profit. In a nutshell, the fiduciary rule is designed to make all financial professionals who provide retirement planning advice or work with retirement plans accountable to the fiduciary standard, as opposed to the more relaxed suitability standard. Many would rather be held to a suitability standard, as the fiduciary standard would cost them money, both in terms of commissions and the added cost of complying with the new regulations. Registered Investment Advisors are bound to a fiduciary standard that was part of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, which essentially says that an advisor must put the client's interests over their own. Here's what you need to know about the fiduciary rule, and why there is strong opposition to it within the financial industry. In addition to these examples, fiduciaries must: The fiduciary standard is much stricter than the ""suitability standard"" that applies to brokers, insurance agents, and other financial professionals.

Pair that jump in education spending with the already massive hole in next years budget, and Brownbacks tax cuts are too big not to fail. The court said the government had failed to allocate enough money for its students, and the justices tossed the decision back to a lower panel to determine what exactly would constitute a sufficient level of spending.

Indeed, he is trying to strengthen that skein and bind it more tightly, as we have seen in his various court cases seeking to uphold or even expand authoritarian powers claimed by Bush, in his escalation of the Afghan war, in his continual expansion of attacks in Pakistan, in his servile coddling and protection of the CIA, and in his celebration of the success and extraordinary achievement of the war crime in Iraq. Thus the mere act of applying the ordinary, bourgeois laws of the land as they stand right now would constitute a world-shaking revolution, an overthrow of the existing order every bit as radical as any ideologues dream of mass uprising.

The Care and Feeding of a Corporate Propagandist.Over the last decade, New Yorker columnist Malcolm Gladwell has managed to metamorphose from a trained shill for Big Tobacco, Big Pharma and the deregulatory movement into an intellectual darling of mainstream liberal America. Journalist Yasha Levine takes us on a brief tour of Gladwells journalism education before highlighting some of his work as a third party (corporate code for media ally) journalist pushing the agenda of American business communities. To quote Philip Morris, a major supporter of the National Journalism Center, its mission was to train budding journalists in free market political and economic principles. In 1982, while still an undergrad, he completed a 12-week training course at the National Journalism Center, a corporate-funded program created to counter the medias alleged anti-business bias by molding college kids into corporate-friendly journalist-operatives and helping them infiltrate top-tier news media organizations. Gladwell was trained up in the same corporate-funded network of training and education institutes and outfits responsible for churning out the likes of Michelle Malkin, convicted criminal James OKeefe, Dinesh DSouza and countless other GOP corporate activists. While a student at the University of Toronto, Gladwells admiration for Ronald Reagan led him into conservative activist circles. Posted by Alexander Reed Kelly Yasha Levine at The Exiled: Perhaps Americans would be less shocked by Malcolm Gladwells journalistic corruption if they were aware of his background. The difference: Unlike Gladwell, they rarely hid their ideological willingness to take cash in exchange for promoting the corporate rights agenda. Read more How did he do it?",1,1

And therein lies the most striking thing about the way the Cubs rallied from three runs down to defeat the San Francisco Giants, 6-5, and advance to the National League Championship Series. Yet somehow, after a Giants throwing error left him on second base, it was Heyward who crossed home plate as the winning run. Down 5-2 entering the ninth inning at ATamp;T Park, the Cubs were three outs away from having to play a decisive fifth game of the division series at Wrigley Field on Thursday night. The Cubs became the second team in Major League history to rally from three runs down in the ninth inning to win a postseason clincher.

Monday's EU talks were held amid mounting tensions over North Korea's nuclear program, following a string of missile tests in recent months that showed new capabilities.

Likewise, Linden says that someone who has a problem with their brain has certain responsibilities to minimize the impact and take good care of themselves, just like someone who has a problem with their heart, and that neither should be treated like criminals or incarcerated for their health problems. This, Linden argues, is an illness, a problem with a persons health, not a moral failing in need of criminal correction: #160;#160;#160;#160; Any one of us could be an addict at any time. But people with blunted dopamine pathways cant experience the neurological rewards of healthy activities the same way others do. When you look at the biology, the only model of addiction that makes sense is a disease-based model, and the only attitude towards addicts that makes sense is one of compassion. Interestingly, it is because addicts enjoy their addictions less, due to blunted dopamine systems, that they need them more, and with a desperate drive to achieve a normal dopamine response, they engage in risky, excessive, and unhealthy behaviors. When pressed about the ramifications of the neuroscience behind addiction for public policy, particularly toward drug addiction, Linden asserts that: Simple possession should never be dealt with predominately in the penal system. If someone has heart disease, they have certain responsibilities to take care of themselves, and if they dont, its not societys problem, it is your own darn fault. Dopamine signaling is how the brain rewards the body for engaging in behaviors that in moderation are not only healthy, but necessary for survival, things like eating food, exercising, and having sex. The human machine is wired to pursue pleasure, and when its pleasure pathways are working properly, this leads to healthy, functional behavior.

More importantly, it allows Reclamation either after a plan is adopted, or upon request of a state or tribal government to take certain actions to mitigate drought-related water shortages. Unfortunately, Reclamation has never made the most of its Drought Relief Act powers, and Congress has not given this program much attention or funding.

11650,"After much consideration, it was mutually determined that it would be more cost effective and logistically practical for the Secret Service to lease space elsewhere, Trump Organization spokeswoman Amanda Miller told The Washington Post in an email. Between late 2015 when Trump was a presidential candidate until last month, the Secret Service maintained a presence in space one floor below Trumps private residence in the tower. The Secret Service, obligated to protect any presidents primary residence, has set up a trailer outside the building on Manhattans Fifth Avenue for use as a command center. Secret Service spokeswoman Catherine Milhoan said the agency is seeking to obtain permanent work space in an appropriate location. The United States Secret Service continues to work with GSA to obtain permanent work space in an appropriate location, she said. Its not clear whether discussions about a lease to put agents back in the building are continuing. President Donald Trump has not visited his office or residence in Trump Tower since taking office. The New York Times reported that a lease agreement fell apart last month, primarily due to an unknown clause in the lease agreement Trumps representatives disagreed with. Neither the Trump Organization nor the U.S. General Services Administration, the agency responsible for government real estate actions, explained the points of conflict. 4 (UPI) The U.S. Secret Service said its leaving its command center at the presidents Trump Tower in Manhattan, because of a lease dispute.

Gabriel is pinning the blame or probable accountability on a prospective EU break-up to strenuous efforts by countries like France and Italy to reduce their fiscal deficits and this push naturally results to some serious political risks. Today, it's a different ballgame altogether as German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel says his country's insistence on austerity in the euro zone has left Europe more divided than ever. The scenario would surely make German's younger and future generations- their children and grandchildren- to curse today's leaders, because Gabriel said the truth is Germany is the biggest beneficiary of the European community, both on the economic and political fronts. Gabriel's Social Democrats (SPD) are junior partner to Merkel' conservatives in her ruling grand coalition and they favor a greater focus on investment, in contrast to Merkel's conservatives who put more emphasis on fiscal discipline as a better foundation for economic prosperity. Der Spiegel magazine asked Gabriel in an interview if he believed he could win more votes by moving more German money to other EU countries, Gabriel said he is aware that such discussion is extremely unpopular. No matter how scary or undesirable the prospect is, with the current state of the EU, there may be no escaping the unthinkable reality that it may indeed break apart. The SPD is poised to select Gabriel to run against Merkel for chancellor in the highly-anticipated September federal election as confirmed by senior party sources. So much so that even the eventual break-up of the European Union is no longer unthinkable. Gabriel said that to this day, Merkel has yet to respond to the question and challenge he posed.

But China and Russia want the JCPOA and Iran is unlikely to try to get a bomb both for this reason and because of Khomeinist commitments (Khomeini, the father of the Islamic Revolution in Iran, called nukes the tools of the devil, and his successor, Ali Khamenei, agrees). If, however, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the agency charged with inspecting Iran, wanted to visit Parchin again, centrist President Hassan Rouhani would allow it. Everyone knows Japan has stockpiles of plutonium and technical know-how, and that they could produce a nuclear weapon in short order if they felt really threatened. (Plutonium signatures can be detected months later and no matter how you try to vacuum up the particles, so Iran really cant cheat as long as it is inspected). There has been a small uptick of Iranian trade with Europe and Asia, but the hard liners are slamming Rouhani for giving away the countrys security and returning empty-handed. Iran has never had the aim of creating a bomb or it would have one by now. Because of Obamas severe sanctions from 2012, a short time-like to break-out incurred unacceptable costs for nuclear doves like Rouhani, who got Khameneis ear and warned him of civil unrest a la 2009 if sanctions continued. By signing the deal, Iran gave up substantial deterrence effects of nuclear latency for the sake of ending sanctions and reducing tensions, by accepting a long break-out time-line. The IAEA does not want to visit Parchin because they think",1,1

Potentially Satoshi is a pseudonym for a group of people, explains Brito. Craig Wright was outted as Satoshi by [news organizations] Wired and Gizmodo a few months back, says Brito. But the evidence these news organizations used to connect Wright to Nakamoto turned out to be bogus and some claim that Wright might even have had a hand in planting the evidence cited by the news organizations,#160;according to Brito.

Look no further than Chaves County, where that commission, relying on the high courts decision last week regarding Bernalillo Countys advisory ballot questions, is proposing not one but five nonbinding poll questions. When Secretary of State Dianna Duran sought to block the advisory questions and limit the ballot to real issues, Supreme Court Justice Barbara Vigil noted during oral arguments that state law allowing Other Questions could be read very broadly. On Nov. 4 they could know if voters are in favor of the Chaves County Commission enacting: These questions, like Bernalillo Countys decriminalizing marijuana and adding a tax for unspecified aid for the mentally ill, are merely advisory and mean zilch other than a transparent attempt to fire up a particular political base.

10075,"Dont wait around for someone else to make the first move: Ive long believed that dating like a feminist which often involves making the first move will weed out many of the guys with more rigid ideas about gender and relationships. It might also help identify the feminist man who doesnt want to come on too strong or who feels it isnt necessarily his responsibility to signal interest. It didnt work out with any of those men, but going out with them made it all the more obvious to me what I want a partner to be: cute, smart, funny and yes, feminist.

If youre a woman who wants a man to grab you and kiss you because thats what sweeps you off your feet, realistically, a feminist man is not going to do that, says Rita Goodroe, a 38-year-old life coach in Virginia who works mostly with singles. Of course, way too many guys think theyre feminists but dont live up to it. Yes, we know that couples who share housework have better sex lives and that the idea of a man down-shifting his career while his wife takes on more responsibilities at work is more rational than radical. Ive been encouraging women to be proactive with their dating lives and now I feel like I dont need to preach that any longer. I see people allude to feminist traits in their profiles, she says, such as men seeking women who are independent or similarly successful or listing Lean In as a book theyve read recently.

10514,"The idea of a laser weapon is to produce a very powerful beam and to rely on its speed-of-light straight-line non-dispersing propagation to deposit energy on a distant target, where it is ultimately absorbed as heat. For some fluid lasers, the energy can be introduced by chemical reactions, or by electric discharges freeing electrons that collide into atoms and molecules to excite them, or by the supersonic expansion of molecular gases whose rapid cooling and rarefaction stops particle collisions and allows an unnatural number of molecules to remain in a particular high energy state for its full lifetime, and thus exceed the population of some lower state. It is probable that laser weapons and other military electronic and electro-optical identify-track-and-kill technology will be used to eliminate specifically targeted, usually poor, darker-skinned individuals in far-flung low intensity war on terror zones, at a cost per kill that will exceed the entire cost of sustaining that persons existence from conception, through maternal care while in utero, through family life, though education and maturation, to rebellion, to imperial inconvenience, to the moment of elimination. Whether a laser is a pulsed or continuously operating device, the population distribution of the medium must be returned to its initial state so that the pumping mechanism can produce another, or a continuing, population inversion. As particles absorb and emit photons, and collide into one another in fluid media, or continuously vibrate into each other in solid-state material, they bump each other up and down in energy level so that on average most reside in low energy levels at any given instant, and decreasing fractions of the entire population are to be found at increasingly higher energy levels. Lasing is accomplished in four steps: 1, pumping a population inversion; 2, creating a cavity resonator; 3, coherently amplifying a selected frequency (color) of light by avalanching a matching stimulated transition, and; 4, depopulating the lower laser level and removing waste heat from the medium. The energy held by molecules excited to the lower laser level must first be spread among even lower levels, and then removed entirely",1,1

Overall, the results were so impressive that Exelixis now plans to submita Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) forCabometyx as a first-line treatment for advanced kidney cancer. However, Exelixis will have a head start if Cabometyxis approved as a first-line treatment for kidney cancer. The drugmaker also has a phase 3 study in progress testing Opdivo and Yervoy as a first-line advanced kidney cancer treatment. And, unlike Exelixis, Pfizer and Bristol both have large product lineups and pipelines that help insulate them from the occasional threat that crops up to thesales of individual drugs. However, neither of the two big drugmakers will be hurt too badly if Exelixis' drug gains approval and does as well as expected.

106,"Instead, house prices could actually start falling as new supply continues to come on to the market, and this effect could be amplified by recession-induced job losses that trigger mortgage defaults by workers losing their jobs. House prices are already at all-time highs by every measureso lower interest rates are unlikely to spur another price boom, with all its expansionary effects. Many (including myself) expected that the bursting of the stock market and Internet bubbles in 2001 would cause a deep recession owing to large excesses of borrowing and spending by both the household and corporate sectors. Moreover, the Fed then held interest rates at historical lows three years after economic recovery had officially begun, so that the Federal funds rate was only 1.35 percent in 2004. This is because the economic factors that helped escape the last recession have been largely exhausted, and will not be available to fight the next recession. Lower interest rates also made houses more affordable, triggering a house price bubble that contributed significantly to escaping the recession. Higher house prices have also allowed some existing homeowners to cash out, and some have spent part of their windfall. It is time for a new paradigm that links growth to rising wages rather than to asset price boom-bust cycles. However, a consumption spending-led recession will quickly spill over into East Asia, triggering job losses and a decline in investment spending in those economies. The main reasons why the last recession was so relatively mild are the federal budget and interest rates. Taken together, these factors point to future interest rate reductions likely being akin to pushing on a string. Lastly, rising house home prices have also created enormous profit margins for builders, providing an incentive to build new homes and spurring a construction industry boom.",1,1

Apple and other tech companies have so far fought the FBIs efforts, stating that giving investigators access to a suspects cellphone will set a dangerous precedent for Internet security. Once appointed by Donald Trump, Wray wasted no time promoting the idea that encryption was something that could actually harm rather than help the people. Wray and the FBI argue that terrorists will use encryption to plan terror attacks. Being unable to access nearly 7,800 devices in a year is a major public safety issue, Wray stated. Speaking at the#160;International Conference on Cyber Security in New York,#160;FBI Director Christopher Wray spoke about challenges that encryption presents to law enforcement. The question is, should the American people trust the FBI to keep them safe? Director Wray also noted that the bureau was unable to access data from 7,775 devices in the 2017 fiscal year that ended September 30. He also defended the FBI against allegations that the bureau is against encryption altogether. This is also the same agency that has been involved in violent house raids in other nations, spying on activists, building a secret massive facial recognition database, secretly recording the public, and the list goes on.

ADVERTISEMENT The lawsuit, using internal Applebees emails and records, also tries to make the case that Applebees corporate leadership had a policy to drive up liquor sales, particularly late at night. According to a Taos News report, the Applebees was subsequently barred from selling liquor for three days and paid a $3,000 fine as part of a stipulated agreement with the state Alcohol and Gaming Division on a citation for serving to an intoxicated person. Applebees employees shouldnt have overserved Varela with 20-ounce Brewtus beers and should have known he was visibly intoxicated and through the exercise of reasonable care they could have, and should have, prevented Julian Varela from leaving the Taos Applebees while being intoxicated before he was struck and killed, the suit maintains.

5408,"They are the people, least responsible for the nations economic downturn, who can supply the drive for such a policy to improve their lives by pumping new revenues into local and state government budgets. The home bubble also boosted property and sales tax revenues for local and state governments to provide vital health, infrastructure and school services. But this federal stimulus points to the need to stabilize the U.S. economy and its blowing of asset bubbles from which flow tax revenues for local and state governments. It is unclear how lawmakers would raise new taxes on stocks and bonds absent sustained pressure from low- and middle-income Americans. To help solve the fiscal crises of U.S. municipalities and states, Wolff proposes taxing citizens rich enough to own significant quantities of stocks and bonds. Part of that home wealth helped some working Americans with stagnant wages to pay their bills. The trends look even worse to low-income Americans, the poor, who were 12.3 percent of the U.S. populace in 2006, using the official federal poverty measures from the 1960s. Together, they are weakening the buying power of wage-earning Americans, also paying higher prices for gas, food and health care insurance. Wolff adds: Owners of property in the form of stocks and bonds should be required to likewise pay property tax on that property instead of being exempted from property taxes. The interest and dividends which big holders of stocks and bonds earn is taxable, but the actual value of these instruments isnt, according to Wolff.

William Galvin, the Democratic secretary of state, testified in support of the bill, saying the public disclosure of tax returns is needed in order for voters to know about a candidates potential conflicts of interest. Healeys certification of the petition came as state lawmakers held a committee hearing and took testimony on a bill that would require U.S. presidential candidates to also disclose their tax returns in order to get onto the ballot. The proposed Massachusetts law would require candidates for U.S. president and vice president to submit to the states secretary copies of their federal income tax returns for the last six years that could then be made public. But Galvin testified that he believed that a law requiring tax returns disclosures could survive a legal challenge as states have a right to set conditions to get on their ballots. Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in May vetoed a bill that would have required the disclosure by presidential candidates of tax returns, calling it politics at its worst. The election-related initiative came after Trump, a Republican, last year became the first major presidential candidate since the 1970s to not voluntarily release at least some of his tax returns. Senator Michael Barrett, the bills Democratic sponsor, in an interview said the bill had a lot of grassroots interest, and was receiving support from March Forward Mass, which formed after the Womens March protest held in January a day after Trump was inaugurated. The states attorney general, Maura Healey, a Democrat, certified the initiative petition along with 20 others covering a variety of topics as having met constitutional requirements for ballot questions.

One simply needs to have increased vigilance because these banks are still vulnerable."" ""You have to say that the cacophony in terms of communication of public authorities is not of a nature to reassure the financial markets,"" he told the newspaper. The Belgian central bank governor said that Belgium's KBC and Franco-Belgian Dexia had reported decent underlying half-year results, but that both had further to go with their restructuring plans, something made more difficult by the current state of financial markets. ""Of course the less favorable economic prospects put in doubt budgetary reductions. However, Coene said that one should not forget political engagement for the plans, which was ""very firm."" Uncertainty remained over the issue of collateral, as demanded by Finland, and the participation of banks. ""I hope for the return of calm to the markets after September when all the measures have been implemented and a program of austerity is operating in Greece. But you should accept that deficits deteriorate a little due to cyclical movements and that you continue to have improvement on a structural basis.",1,3

At the other church, this spokesman says his sect are the rightful owner of the roof and will carry out necessary repairs, but doesn't think any repairs are needed.

Wheeler will also propose a rule that will attempt to close another loophole that allowed coordinated bidding between parties, which other companies complain let Dish coordinate with its partners in the most recent auction. FCC scrambles to shut loophole after Dish Network partners grab $3.3 billion in small-business discounts.Federal regulators will be shutting down a loophole that allowed partners of satellite-TV provider Dish Network to get $3.3 billion in discounts in wireless auctions that were intended to go to small businesses. Because of these tactics by Dish, the last auction set a record in terms of bids, reaching $45 billion. Dish has said in the past that it follows the rules and that other companies put in place similar strategies. Because bidding is anonymous while the auction is in progress, Dish was able to coordinate with its partners by telling everyone about the arrangement beforehand. Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission charged with overseeing the auctions, is planning on placing a cap on the size of the discounts to small businesses to about $150 million in the auction next year. The FCC had allowed companies to work together as long as they were up front with their intentions, but Wheeler thinks thats not good enough and that the practice needs to end. A new cap will be set for each subsequent auction. The FCC proposal isnt in place yet, as it will receive a vote in July. Dish had no comment about the decision, according to the WSJ report. The two companies, SNR Wireless and Northstar Wireless, received the 25 percent discount.",0,2

Opioids (probably) wont destroy your life While there are certainly people who develop addictions to opioids, becoming so addicted one turns to a life of crime and homelessness to support a drug habit because they happened to use Percocet is exceedingly rare. Christie has also been a vocal opponent of marijuana legalization, believing it to be a gateway drug and taxes on it to be blood money, despite the fact that theres growing evidence that marijuana and increased accessibility to it may help many with pain and help reduce deaths associated with prescription pain relievers. The drug war is the problem, not opioids Making clear the dangers of drug mixing, removing politicians from doctor-patient relationships, emphasizing harm reduction, supporting the expansion of medication-assisted treatment and permitting legal access to heroin and other drugs would do more to save lives than even the most soft-hearted drug prohibition. Opioid overdoses usually involve more than just opioids and often entail the mixing of multiple drugs, like alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine and fentanyl, either by choice (as is typically true of the first three substances) or due to unscrupulous black market dealers tainting their product (with fentanyl). Likewise, as is the case with resistance to talking about drug mixing, politicians simply dont want to acknowledge the fact that it is drug prohibition which has made heroin as dangerous as it is. According to a 2014 report, nearly 60 percent of long-term opioid users took a combination of drugs that could potentially be fatal with benzodiazepines being particularly common. This is consistent with research indicating rates of abuse or addiction among people prescribed opioids could be as little as 0.27 percent of people prescribed opioids to 4.5 percent.

He says this new twist on a comfort food was driven by Toppers customers requesting some type of tater tot pizza via the companys social media channels. Part of the allure might be driven by the fact that, according to a Wall Street Journal story about potato consumption, were no longer buying or cooking as many potatoes at home. To make even more money selling them, restaurant owners are adding spices (even McDonalds is testing this concept) and topping them with gravies, sauces and dressings.

Yet theres also the feeling that United fans just havent warmed to a player who is associated, rightly or wrongly, with the most difficult period in the clubs recent history. You have to go back nearly four years before Uniteds miserable years under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal to a similar display of emotion, when Robin van Persie ran along the touchline and embraced Alex Ferguson after scoring a match-clinching penalty against Stoke in April 2013 as United closed in on the Premier League title. Under Mourinho, Fellaini has had less game time, especially since November when United has generally gone with a midfield of Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and Paul Pogba.

That was chiefly because a week earlier, he had come on as a late sub against Everton and conceded a penalty that was scored to deny United victory. Given Fellainis characteristics, the midfielder could have a vital role to play for United in the second half of the season. The bear-hug celebration showed the togetherness and improving bond between Mourinho and his players, a factor that cannot have helped but aid United during its current run of nine straight victories in all competitions. A month ago, the Belgium international was booed by sections of Old Trafford not for the first time as he warmed up as a substitute late in the second half of Uniteds win over Tottenham.

5434,"At one point, Cruz criticized the Affordable Care Act for having a chilling impact on prospective medical school students. In addition, we find that medical school applicants are rising even more quickly than enrollment, despite the claim by Cruzs spokesperson that interest in medical schools has not kept up with the demand for more physicians. Total medical school enrollment has increased every year since President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. In the end, theres simply no evidence for Cruzs claim that Obamacare is discouraging people from going to medical school and training to be doctors. Grover said his organization in 2006 set a goal of increasing first-year medical student enrollment by 30 percent by 2015-2016 (from the 2002-2003 level) to address the physician shortage. One reason: The number of physicians completing their graduate medical education has risen from about 27,000 to about 29,000 annually, the report said. He said those figures show that medical schools are doing their part to prepare the next generation of health care professionals, but he called on Congress to lift the residency caps and increase federal support for residency training. In its 2015 press release, the AAMC said#160;the number of first-time medical school applicants is an important indicator of interest in medicine. We have not seen any indication of declining interest in medicine since the [Affordable Care Act] took effect, Atul Grover, an executive vice president at the#160;Association of American Medical Colleges, told us in a phone interview.

In an email to us, Cruzs spokesperson#160;wrote:#160;While one could argue this point based on economic theory, and its difficult to prove through the numbers exactly why the increased demand brought on by the ACA has not been reflected in a proportionate increase in doctors, the claim was not false from a fact-check perspective, and to say so would be misleading conjecture.

While numerous intellectuals, activists and ordinary members of Jewish communities around the world have strongly protested Israels treatment of the Palestinians, as well as Israels misuse of the Jewish religion to attain political goals, Israel relies greatly on the support of Jewish communities, organizations and individuals for vital funds, political support and lobbying. It goes without saying there should be no room for any racist discourse Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, or any other in the Palestine solidarity movement, which aims at achieving long-denied justice and rights for the Palestinian people. But the Jewish and democratic state of Israel is riddled with so many contradictions, the kind that no straightforward narrative can possibly capture. The greater tragedy is that Dershowitz is provided with platforms in mainstream and rightwing Israeli media, thus giving his smear campaign the means to turn any genuine discussion of Israel into a controversial hate speech. These include one that would end the status of Arabic as one of Israels official languages and another that would punish Israeli citizens, including Arab Israelis, for refusing to pledge their allegiance to Israel as a Jewish and democratic state, according to columnist Linda Heard (Arab News, Jan 24). Even Resnicks political dissent is riddled with inconsistencies, where national identity (as an American) clashes with ideology (Zionism) and religion (the Torah) is referenced as a means to resolve the discord. The TIME story references one such youth, Benjamin Resnick, 27, who decries the fact that Jewish state and American liberal democracy represent two views that are irreconcilable.

If the World Court were to affirm that there is no statute of limitations for starting illegal wars and indict those that engineered the Iraq War (The Bush-Cheney cabinet, those who made off with book deals as opposed to trials at the Hague), perhaps the world can begin to have a conversation about justice and American exceptionalism. The Legacy of the Iraq War.In the United States, the most significant event of 2011 hands down should have been the withdrawal of the last U.S. troops from Iraq. This has led to the exponential growth of the U.S. military machine, for permanent preemptive wars to be fought overseas and at home. In the U.S. narrative as repeated in U.S. media this war was waged to prevent Iraq from terrorizing the world, never mind that all the evidence was trumped up. In fact, especially with the use of drone technology, the entire world has now become a battlefield, including the United States, obviating the need for trials, etc. Not counting enemy casualties seems to be the ultimate form of dehumanization (The non-governmental Iraq Body Count group officially lists between 104, 308 113,962 Iraqi documented deaths). In the United States, for the past 10 years, the Black Man has gotten a short reprieve; now, it is the fear and hate of brown men, women and children that is driving this frenzied effort to protect the homeland.

In a rambling answer to a reporters question, Trump said Bannon was a friend, who came late to his 2016 campaign. Hours after Bannons departure was confirmed Friday by the White House, the former Hollywood producer and news executive returned to duty as executive chairman of Breitbart News, the pugilistic conservative website he helped guide before joining Trumps campaign last August. (This week the White House announced the new interim director will be 28-year-old Hope Hicks, who is credited with understanding what Trump wants when dealing with the press.) The populist-nationalist movement got a lot stronger today, Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow said in a release. The Council for American-Islamic Relations executive director Nihad Awad also welcomed Bannons removal from a position he never should have been given, and called for the removal of like-minded staffers Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, and Sebastian Gorka, a deputy assistant to the president. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it was welcome news, but it doesnt disguise where President Trump himself stands on white supremacists and the bigoted beliefs they advance. Later, and also on a Friday afternoon, Trump fired his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and replaced him with Kelly. Then Tuesday, Trump was back blaming both sides which set corporate leaders scurrying away from Trumps presidential advisory boards and led many Democrats and Republicans to lambaste the president. The 63-year-old Bannon had been on shaky ground for weeks and Trump declined to express confidence in him during an impromptu press conference Tuesday.

8322,"(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal) After several rounds of spending cuts, majority House Democrats say the state needs more revenue in the form of tax and fee increases to replenish depleted cash reserves and keep public schools and state programs afloat. The budget bill approved 10-6 Monday in the House Appropriations and Finance Committee would keep overall state spending largely flat but would increased spending that flows to school districts statewide by roughly $32 million and provide a 2.5 percent funding increase for the states cash-strapped judicial system. On party-line votes, Democrats on two different House committees Monday pushed through a $6.1 billion spending plan for the coming budget year, and a $265 million tax package to help fund it. If both the budget bill and tax package legislation were approved, the states cash reserves would go up to an estimated $149 million or 2.5 percent of state spending. Although some GOP lawmakers have proposed overhauling the states tax code to make it fairer and easier to understand, they balked Monday at the Democratic-backed plan to raise tax rates. But some agencies would fare better than others: Higher education: 1 percent decrease ($7.6 million) Courts: 2.5 percent increase ($3.9 million) Medicaid: 0.2 percent increase ($2.1 million) State-run prisons: 1.6 percent decrease ($4.6 million) Public schools: Flat (funding for school districts would increase, but dollars for Public Education Department initiatives would go down) Tax package HB 202 would raise $265 million by: Increasing the tax on vehicle sales. Both the tax and budget bills could still be changed before being voted on by the full House. If the package doesnt pass, spending levels prescribed in the budget bill would end up being about $218 million more than expected in state revenue.

Like others Republican operatives, Shields said the partys ability to enact the rest of Trumps agenda taxes, infrastructure and the border wall could help mitigate how upset people will be about health care. Republicans hoped the issue would bring some party unity, even as realists in Washington view the a tax overhaul something that hasnt happened in more than 30 years as one of the most complex legislative projects possible. Around the country, Republican voters continue to support efforts to repeal former President Barack Obamas health law, even if there is little agreement on an alternative. A CNN poll released last week found that 83 percent of Republicans favor some form of repeal, while only 11 percent of Republicans want the party to abandon the repeal effort. McCain, whose dramatic no vote killed the bill, is serving his last term in office, has brain cancer and is hardly moved by electoral threats. ADVERTISEMENT The leaders of other groups, such as Women Vote Trump, have begun to court primary challengers to punish those members of Congress deemed insufficiently committed to President Donald Trumps agenda. For now at least, many Trump supporters blame the Republican Partys problems on its leaders in Congress. If this is part of a general trend, he said of the GOPs governing struggles, I think that can be pretty disastrous",0,0
3927,"So draconian are the countrys pro-life laws that even women who lose their unborn babies during medical emergencies can be jailed. Malta is the only European country where abortion is 100 percent illegal even if the life of the woman is at risk or the unwanted pregnancy is the result of rape. Ireland The death in 2012 of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died after being denied an abortion under the countrys strict pro-life laws, sparked outrage across Ireland and forced the government to relax restrictions. Legalization of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving womens health; in some countries, such as India, where abortion has been legal for decades, access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers, the WHO said, highlighting poverty, weak health care systems and social attitudes toward women. Laws that limit or prevent legal abortions contribute to the deaths of tens of thousands of women every year, mostly, but not exclusively, in the developing world. But rape survivors who become pregnant as a result of their sexual assault are not allowed to get a legal abortion or even take a morning-after pill. That means Irish women who have been raped or who are carrying a non-viable pregnancy still go abroad or resort to dangerous methods (like drinking bleach) to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.

""We are looking for one final job for me to work before I retire,"" said Bailey, currently a tenured linguistics professor at Alabama. ADVERTISEMENT During opening remarks, Bailey quickly addressed a question on the minds of many observers: Why is he seeking a new job as a university president when he resigned from the same post in Tuscaloosa last October after less than two months on the job? According to news reports last year, Bailey said he resigned so his wife would not push herself to carry out the social duties expected of a university president's wife. Bailey said his wife's condition has greatly improved over the last ""four or five months;"" her weight has stabilized without the aid of intravenous feeding, and so he was able to pursue a new post. Bailey said his wife was treated for the problem and got her weight up when they arrived in Alabama, but the problem quickly surfaced again, leading to his resignation. Bailey said his wife Jan, a two-time cancer survivor, had developed a problem absorbing nutrients, which caused her to lose weight at an alarming rate. Bailey's roots are in the South, but he said he came to appreciate NMSU while at Texas Tech, where recruiters in Lubbock, Texas, sought to lure away New Mexico high school graduates.

Given the conditions the buildings were in, combined with a federal mandate to demolish 14,000 units, the CHA had to create an aggressive Plan. For example, the CHA is working on the rehabilitation or redevelopment of its six City/State properties, which, in total, included 929 project-based Section 8 rental units. By the end of 2009, CHA will have rehabilitated or constructed 20,000 public housing units and an additional 5,000 affordable and market-rate units.

Once you have an idea of how much monthly income you'll need to cover these living costs, head over to the Social Security Administration's website Opens a New Window., create a personalized account,and see what your expected monthly payout will be. But for those of you nearing retirement -- say, 10 years or less away from the big day -- you should have a much clearer idea of your future monthly expenses. A more useful way to approach retirement planning is to figure out how much monthly income you'll need and how you will generate that income. After decades of working and receiving a paycheck and income on a monthly basis, when we retire, we're expected to know how to take one lump sum of money and turn it into an income stream. Retirement accounts are where many Americans stash their long-term savings, yet few of us have experience managing so much money at one time. And while these can be complex products, they can assist you in generating income from your accumulated assets by annuitizing a portion of your savings and sending you a fixed amount every month, possibly for the rest of your life. If there's a gap between your Social Security benefit and your non-discretionary monthly expenses (and there almost definitely will be), you'll need to go to your next income source: your retirement savings. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year! If your retirement is decades away, it's difficult to forecast what your monthly expenses will be and what your life will look like. But it's the sort of question you may have to answer when you're finally ready to retire and start living off of your retirement savings.

Today even the most optimistic immigration reform advocates in both parties agree that comprehensive reform will die this year at the hands of a House GOP leadership thats afraid to bring the subject up. Though the report was talking about the willingness to learn from election analysis instead of coming up with conspiracy theories to explain defeats, I think its safe to say that an environment of intellectual curiosity isnt the first term that comes to mind generally about a Republican Party that dismisses climate science and encourages taxpayer support for sectarian schools. It bluntly contrasted the performance of the GOP in presidential and non-presidential elections and argued that the national partys image had to change, even if that meant thinking beyond the alleged perfection of the Reagan legacy. Yes, there were arguments about whether the remodeling of the GOP involved mere mechanics and sloganeering, or something a bit deeper, and there was significant disagreement as to the principal target of fresh Republican thinking: Hispanics, young voters, women, or even the restive Tea Party base. But aside from those who chose simply to blame Mitt Romney for the 2012 defeat, there was general agreement that something needed to happen to expand or intensify the GOPs electoral appeal before the next presidential cycle, and the midterms were regarded as a fine opportunity for a test run.

Recently, Republicans borrowed the White Houses balanced approach talking point to pressure Democrats into offering significant entitlement reform. Republicans are also accusing the White House of relentless campaigning, during presidential meetings this week with CEOs, small business owners and middle-class taxpayers. While politicians continue to score headlines and photo ops, theres a growing sense of concern lawmakers and the White House will fail to reach a deal before the end of the year.

Since last summer, party leaders and their staffs have been trading deficit-reducing measures through high-level talks and the failed super committee. But, Congressional Democrats said entitlements should be part of a later, separate discussion and instead want immediate tax increases on families earning more than $250,000 a year to go along with the $1 trillion in budget cuts Congress passed last year. Whether they succeed depends, in part, on both sides concluding that its better for them to strike a deal now rather than strike one in a post-fiscal-cliff world.

1994,"In his Bill of Rights Day proclamation this year, Obama declared: The United States will always speak for those who are voiceless, defend those who are oppressed, and bear witness to those who want nothing more than to exercise their universal human rights. President Bill Clinton, in an April 19, 1994, television interview, declared, When we got organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans, it was assumed that the Americans who had that freedom would use it responsibly. Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1787, A Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference. The Bill of Rights did not give freedom to Americans; instead, the Bill of Rights expressly prohibited the government from violating pre-existing rights of the people. Subsequent politicians have done their best to make Americans view the Bill of Rights as simply another government handout. Americans need to remember Bill of Rights Day but for the proper reason. The Founding Fathers had difficulty getting the Constitution approved in many states not because it was radical in protecting peoples rights from the government - but because it was perceived as concentrating too much power within the federal government to violate the rights of the people. Insofar as the government perennially violates the Bill of Rights, it becomes an aggressor against the American people. The Bill of Rights was not radical according to the beliefs of Americans of that era; instead, it codified rights both long recognized in English common law or that had been carved out over centuries of resistance to English tyranny. Presidents and members of Congress take an oath to uphold the Constitution - and thus to respect the rights recognized and guaranteed by the Bill of Rights. FDR called the Bill of Rights the great American charter of personal liberty and human dignity, but proceeded to label the rights privileges and then listed only privileges contained in the First Amendment. FDR then asserted that free schools could not exist without the Bill of Rights, though there was nothing about education in the first 10 amendments.",1,1

753,"Looking at the Tip of a Respiratory Virus Iceberg.Last week, there were dozens of stories about American children flooding emergency rooms in 10 states; they were infected with a cold-like virus that devastated their respiratory systems. While we wait for our government develop a workable pandemic response plan, parents with young children should make themselves aware of Enterovirus D68 symptoms, and learn when to seek medical attention if those symptoms present: However, if a child gets a respiratory illness, particularly if they are coughing continuously, short of breath or breathing fast, wheezing and not able to sleep, parents should seek assistance with a physician or the emergency department, said Queens University infectious diseases expert Dr. Dick Zoutman. Yet the real number of severe respiratory illnesses caused by this virus is probably even higher, the CDC says. The respiratory virus thats been sweeping the nation and sending asthmatic children to the hospital may have only been officially reported in 97 children, but experts say thats just the tip of the iceberg. The failure thus far to confront and fight Ebola comes from shortfalls in three areas: gauging the true scope of the outbreak, deploying therapeutics to effectively combat the virus, and delivering medical equipment and personnel. In the American Midwest, for instance, a novel virus classified as Enterovirus 68 has recently sent some 300 children to the hospital in respiratory distress, with no available antiviral therapy or vaccine. They also mention Enterovirus D68 in their detailed and worrisome analysis: While Ebola may still be contained, other potentially calamitous threats are out there. The rare enterovirus starts out like the common cold but can quickly turn more serious especially in children with asthma. Part of this trend is self-induced; for example, areas of California have vaccination rates less than that in the Sudan because of parents filing Personal Belief Exemptions. A significant proportion of these children are having difficulties needing extra oxygen, fluids and a significant number are ending up in intensive care units and so we want to make sure that those symptoms are picked up early, he said.

9461,"Although the study did find credit scores to be predictive of individual task performance, the researchers did not find a significant relationship between credit score and theft or counterproductive workplace behavior--the rationale frequently used by companies to require credit checks for candidates. Its not enough that we have to keep up with three different versions that never seem to quite agree, but nowadays we must also be ready to defend our scores during a job interview.#160; The use of credit background checks in applicant screening is fairly common practice in this country. However, this doesnt mean that credit score should necessarily be used by employers when making hiring decisions--there are numerous other tools and techniques available for predicting performance that are far more job relevant and less invasive, including structured interviews, personality assessments, and skills tests. Whats likely happening is that those who are conflict avoidant are prone to being taken advantage of, particularly when it comes to saying no to store credit card offers or family members looking for a cosigner on loan. Whitman and his team found a positive relationship between credit score and what they termed as task performance and citizenship behavior. Credit scores can be adversely affected by factors outside of ones control, which means the most honest and law abiding citizens can have a bad score. One of the most interesting findings of the study is that an individuals level of agreeableness correlates with their credit score. The study finds that the more disagreeable a person is, the higher the credit score. In other words, higher credit scores correlated to good performance and positive workplace behavior. According to the Society for Human Resource Management, 60% of employers check applicants credit reports for at least some of their job candidates as part of their hiring process.

The new regulations, which are yet to be finalized, are part of the governments effort to push the tobacco industry toward developing alternatives that may be less dangerous than cigarettes, said the FDA in a press release on Friday. Even though the non-burning alternatives are thought to have less health risks, their impact has yet to be fully studied.Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 a year, according to the FDA. Washington lobbyists for the $130 billion American tobacco industry are expected to put up a fight to fend off what some believe could be the most sweeping federal effort to reduce smoking since the US Congress required cigarette packages to carry health warnings in 1965. Tobacco shares plunge as US government vows to cut nicotine in cigarettes.The US Food and Drug Administration has announced its plan to cut nicotine in conventional cigarettes to nonaddictive levels, pushing tobacco companies stocks into the red.

The FDA plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to nonaddictive levels through achievable product standards, the agency said Friday.

12857,"Continue Reading Below The trade gap in goods and services fell 9.6% in February from a month earlier to a seasonally adjusted $43.56 billion, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. trade gap with China has fallen 4.9% this year compared to the same period last year. The U.S. economy runs a trade gap because Americans households and companies buy many goods and commodities--including cars, oil and beef--from other regions like Asia, Europe and South America. The U.S. trade deficit shrank sharply in February as overseas customers snapped up American products and services, the latest sign U.S. factories are benefiting from global economic stability. President Trump made the nation's trade deficit with China a key theme of his presidential campaign, accusing the Asian nation of manipulating its currency at the expense of U.S. exporters. The U.S. trade deficit has gained political significance over the past two years with the ascendance of Donald Trump to the presidency. But growth is expected to rebound in the second quarter in part due to the recent increase in exports, which is leading factories to ramp up hiring and production to meet higher demand. Tuesday's report showed the value of imports from China declined at a record pace in February. U.S. Trade Gap Shrinks As Exports Rise. Economic growth remained sluggish overall in the first three months of the year, in part due to the persistent trade deficit. The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its closely watched index of manufacturing activity expanded in March for the seventh consecutive month. Private-sector economists estimate the economy grew at about a 1% annual rate in the first quarter, down from the fourth quarter's 2.1% expansion.",1,3

Pharmaceutical industry gearing up to defend drug prices..................................................................................................................................................................................... Politico reported Tuesday that the new dues will boost the lobbying groups budget by 50 percent, giving it more than $300 million to draw on. Trumps plan also includes unspecified regulatory reform that would remove barriers to entry into free markets for drug providers that offer safe, reliable and cheaper products, according to his campaign health policy. Although drug prices havent been a topic in the late stages of the presidential campaign, they were in the primaries, and the lobbying group clearly anticipates the issue could rear its head again after the election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has called out drug companies for excessive price hikes and has introduced a plan to stop price gouging on old drugs, introducing the threat of fines or the importing of drugs from other countries. And a glimpse behind the scenes at the Clinton campaign may give big pharma reason to worry. Pharmaceutical companies have already been spending heavily on a ballot question in California that would bar state agencies from paying more for a drug than the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Good salaries attracted Americans to Iran at that time and the negative attitude communicated by a few Americans toward Iranians prompted Iranians to resent the Americans presence.

Whatever actually happens some months from now, Maines GOP will probably continue to face schisms between compromise-minded center-right Republicans, the traditional Maine establishment, and libertarians and Tea Partiers positioned further to the right and much less open to governing across party lines. Just when it seemed that long-serving solid Republican incumbents would avoid losing primary fights to Tea Party identified candidates, Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran was forced into a run-off he barely won, and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor surprisingly lost his primary by a large margin to a poorly funded college professor backed by grassroots Virginia Tea Partiers. In November 2012, Republicans faced big defeats, as Mainers installed Democratic majorities in both the Maine House and Senate, endorsed same-sex marriage, elected moderate Independent Angus King to the U.S. Senate, and voted to re-elect President Barack Obama. Suddenly, Maine ended up with a very conservative, all-Republican state government, even as Maine Republicans fell into deep schisms between an older GOP establishment and libertarian and Tea Party factions. Rather than coming together after the nomination was decided, Kevin Raye did not attend the Republican unity rally and has not endorsed Bruce Poliquin for the November 2014 general election, where the opponent is a relatively centrist Democrat.

3096,"""I know Michael (Dell), he will continue to run his empire the way he has always done - without any outside influence,"" said Joachim Kempin, once Microsoft's top executive in charge of its relationships with PC makers, who left the company in 2002. ""Dell is one of the best at building hardware and putting an operating system on it,"" said Michael Cherry, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, an independent consultancy. ""This investment might help Microsoft influence whether Dell adopts Android or not, that is likely the goal behind this,"" said Parakh. This time, Microsoft made extra efforts not to alienate its other PC makers, talking to them before inking the deal, said sources familiar with Microsoft's relations with its partners, and holding off from an ownership stake. The investment in the landmark $24 billion buyout led by Michael Dell marks the latest step in Microsoft's plan to gain more influence over the hardware supply chain - a departure from the decades-old, software-centric philosophy that helped it dominate the computing world but is now increasingly under threat. Microsoft, advised by Lazard Ltd, declined to comment on the terms of the Dell loan, or what exactly it gets in return, but made it clear it would look for ""opportunities to support"" companies that buy in to Windows, in whatever form. Some analysts suggest Microsoft got involved in the deal to learn more from Dell about selling to businesses and individuals. ""I don't think Microsoft is going to run Dell at any time or have a dispositive say in what Dell does,"" said one source familiar with Microsoft's thinking, who asked not to be named. With the rise of Google trying to sell into enterprises, it should help Microsoft to have some influence over one of the largest IT vendors, said Parakh.

""The share of young adults with jobs has climbed in the past year, and that will help many of them move out of their parents' homes,"" says Jed Kolko, chief economist at online real estate firm Trulia. When renters stay put, fewer apartments are available for new tenants, which in turn drives up rents. ""There's very little new supply being added anywhere else,"" says Nadji, ""so that's why there's so much pressure on rents and very little choice for the average renter.""

2648,"Neil Kinkopf, a former lawyer in the Clinton administrations Office of Legal Counsel, wrote a Legal Affairs article a while back noting that Republican administrations for decades have adhered to this exclusivity view of the executive branchthe view that the Constitution divides executive and congressional power into separate spheres, and one cannot encroach on the other. The view appeared in 1989, when then-Assistant Attorney General William Barr wrote a memo to all federal agencies saying: Only by consistently and forcefully resisting congressional incursions can Executive Branch prerogatives be preserved. In 1989 the first Bush administration tried to use the exclusivity view before the Court to strike down a law authorizing whistleblowers to bring lawsuits on behalf of the federal government against fraudulent contractors. Congress ordered the mailing regardless, but a Court filled with Miers-esque judges might have sided with Reagan. In 1988 the Court upheld a congressional law creating an independent counsel to investigate and prosecute government wrongdoing, on the theory that Congress may regulate the executive branch. And it came up in the torture memos written in 2002 by Jay Bybee and John Yoo, arguing that the executive has sole control over the military, and as such, Congress cannot stop the president from ordering torture or other coercive interrogation methods. At minimum, he suggested that Miers would be the staunchest proponent of executive power over that of the other two branches that the Court had seen in a very long time. A judge sympathetic to the imperial presidency view is a very bad thing, and seems to me like a much bigger deal than Miers supposed lack of qualifications. Harold Meyerson reports that Andy Card is confirming some of my worst fears on Harriet Miers: As White House chief-of-staff, [Card] found the most intriguing article, he said, to be Article II, which established the presidency and the executive branch.

Based on the early evidence of higher traffic and engagement from short term initiatives, I wouldn't be surprised to see eBay add a few percentage points to its revenue and earnings growth, but that may not be enough for investors who want to assemble a stock portfolio that can beat the market average return. The first step is what management calls ""structured data,"" where eBay is using artificial intelligence to improve search and better organize the one billion listings on eBay's marketplace so as to showcase items as products as opposed to listings.#160;What eBay is really trying to do here is transform its image from an auction site to a mainstream retailer. However, it's difficult to make the case that eBay is overvalued, with the stock trading at less than 16 times expected earnings.#160;The important question is:#160;Can the company grow enough to satisfy shareholders? Investors who buy the stock today will likely only earn a return over time that approximates eBay's earnings growth, which may not be enough for investors seeking a higher return on their investment. The higher growth of these large competitors relative to eBay highlights another problem eBay faces going forward. In the second quarter, there was an uptick in purchase consideration from buyers in the fashion category, as well as an increase in traffic from new eBay visitors, which was attributed to the new advertising campaign. But there hasn't been much growth, as you can see in this table: Management has been active on a few fronts to get the eBay marketplace growing faster and better positioned competitively for the future of e-commerce. This leaves investors with a question that has no easy answer right now: Are these extra investments in structured data and marketing going to improve growth, or are they simply just necessary expenditures in order to maintain current sales volume in the face of mounting pressure from other retail giants? of about 16 and based on management's guidance for 2017 earnings per share, eBay's stock doesn't look overvalued.

Not only did Obama's ransom payment clearly violate the law, it also has provided Iran with more cash to funnel to its terror proxies like Hezbollah, and the administration has now put a price on the head of Americans, emboldening terror regimes like Iran to abduct and jail Americans knowing that they can get a serious haul in return. ""Its time for the Obama White House to drop the charade and admit it paid a $400 million ransom to the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism,"" Priebus said in a statement released on the GOP's official website. Obama and his sycophants in the media have attempted to spin the payment as being a part of a failed arms deal in 1979, but former CIA agent Phil Houston has pointed out in LawNewz that Obama never denied that the failed arms deal was a payment was a prerequisite toward freeing the Americans imprisoned in Iran. The report, coming from The Wall Street Journal, found that the administration would not let the Iranians have possession of the money until the plane carrying three Americans that had been jailed in Iran left, which essentially proves that the payment was indeed a ransom payment. Iran clearly viewed it as a ransom payment and gloated about it, pastor Saeed Abedini has said that he was told by an Iranian official that they weren't allowed to leave another plane arrived, and Obama has shown time and again that he's lied about the Iran deal and has even paid ransom to Iran before.

That brighter outlook makes TerraForm a compelling solar stock to consider buying as we enter the third quarter. And when it comes to valuation, First Solar is probably cheap, carrying almost half of its market cap in cash and investments, and trading for between 22 times and 32 times guidance for full-year earnings, and less than 10 times peak earnings before the current cyclical slowdown. Considering the upside in the years to come, now's an excellent time to invest in First Solar. If the company can maintain its pricing power while riding the solar boom, then SolarEdge is a stock worth putting on your radar.

At last count, First Solar had more than $1.65 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and less than $300 million in debt, giving it a huge margin of safety while the solar industry rebalances cyclical demand.

Ill be interested to see if you agree with me that this absence of shame or other social sanction, apart from the law itself, produces in our last two movies a curious sort of reversal of the tendency that has been evident up until now, even in the earlier movies, of romanticizing criminality. Think back to Tommy Powers in The Public Enemy and how, for all his cockiness, he would never have wanted his mother to know how he made his living, just as his mother never wanted to know, though she gets some pretty broad hints about it from her other son, Michael. Looked at in this way, the film might even represent a return to older ideas about crime and punishment after more than half a century of the movies creeping romanticization of criminality, culminating in Bonnie and Clyde. In one way that must have seemed like a great liberation to the film-makers of the 70s and 80s, since it allowed for cleaner treatment of the plot and a merely intellectual appreciation of it s complexities untroubled by unnecessary moral considerations. It occurred to me that what must have struck people either for good or ill about that movie, as about so many other things that were going on in the culture at the same time, was its shamelessness. At one level, Body Heat belongs to a new class of films like Rosemarys Baby or Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct or The Good Son or Double Jeopardy designed to exploit peoples fears of relationships contracted in a social context from which traditional restraints enforced by shame are absent. Though there is, apparently, no inherited social stigma about it to deter them from what they are going to do, at least the guy ought to have enough of a care for his own self-interest to see the danger to himself in it, and its his own fault if he doesnt.

Like so many people who have been beaten in a verbal encounter, and who can think of clever things to say the next day, after it is all over, President Obama, after his clear loss in his debate with Mitt Romney, called Governor Romney a phony. In his speech delivered in a ghetto-style accent that Obama doesnt use anywhere except when he is addressing a black audience he charged the federal government with not showing the same concern for the people of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina hit as they had shown for the people of New York after the 9/11 attacks, or the people of Florida after hurricane Andrew hit. Some people in the media have tried to dismiss this and other revelations of Barack Obamas real character that have belatedly come to light as old news. Senator Obama, as he was then, pointed out that this requirement was waived in the case of New York and Florida because the people there were considered to be part of the American family. Because, less than two weeks earlier, on May 24, 2007, the United States Senate had in fact voted 80-14 to waive the Stafford Act requirement for New Orleans, as it had waived that requirement for New York and Florida. The Congressional Record for May 24, 2007 shows Senator Barack Obama present that day and voting on the bill that waived the Stafford Act requirement. But the people in New Orleans predominantly black they dont care about as much, according to Barack Obama. Nor can Barack Obama claim that he wasnt present the day of that Senate vote, as he claimed he wasnt there when Jeremiah Wright unleashed his obscene attacks on America from the pulpit of the church that Obama attended for 20 years.

Trumps White House meeting with the Russian officials came after a meeting with Henry Kissinger, prompting many to draw parallels between the presidents firing of Comey and the Saturday Night Massacre in which President Nixon ordered his attorney general to fire the special prosecutor tasked with investigating Watergate. Reporters were ushered into the Oval Office afterwards to see Trump not with the Russians, but with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Adding fuel to the media fire, Trump also invited Henry Kissinger, the late President Nixons larger-than-life Secretary of State and National Security Advisor. It would be an understatement to assert that this is bad optics for an administration under fire from the entire Democratic party and a handful of high-ranking Republican lawmakers over its handling of a federal investigation into the Trump campaigns alleged links to Russia.

A year later the commercial media is dutifully revisiting the story, as if to sell the public on the notion that they-a defacto extension of the government-actually care about Americas poor; they do not. The truth is that wealthy white Plutocrats are in control of the government, and they dont give a damn about anyone they cannot exploit; and that is the observation of a white man. The world saw Bushs cavalier disregard for Americas poor on August 29, 2005; and they have seen it every day since. People with wealth and property matter in America; those without do not. That is how the government has always treated the poor, just as it has always exploited the working class and sent them to die in wars not of their making. Thousands of poor black families-those who did not drown, were forced from their homes and will never be allowed to return. Throughout the Gulf Coast Region the homes of the poor were razed by bulldozers and earth moving machines in order to make way for the developers. In effect, New Orleans was ethnically cleansed by the government; the same government that abandoned the poor and went on vacation when Katrina made landfall. But what does one expect from a government that evokes imminent domain to demolish low income housing across the country, and turns it over to developers for private gain?

6724,"(Courtesy of R2 Architectural Design) Copyright 2012 Albuquerque Journal The University of New Mexico is challenging a $6.2 million private project to renovate a boarded-up 150-room motel near The Pit and University Stadium into what could functionally be called studio apartments for anywhere from overnight to long-term rental. Murphy said that in recent years the area near UNMs South Campus has seen new development such as the 240-apartment Broadstone Towne Center; privately owned Lobo Village, an apartment-style dormitory for students; plus restaurants and a city fire station. ADVERTISEMENT University Villages plan is to convert the 150 motel rooms into what could be called 350-square-foot studio apartments available for rent by the night, week or month, Allen said. ADVERTISEMENT Williams had earlier told the Journal that the former Vagabond Inn project had to meet a host of city regulations, but that the length of stay for future guests wasnt one of them. UNM wants the property to remain a motel and has asked the city for a declaratory ruling to restrict the propertys use to an overnight or limited-stay motel. Neither the zoning code nor the approved site development plan for the property specifically limit the number of days the same person (or persons) can occupy the same room, he said in an email. However, it did kill plans for a possible freestanding shop on an unused corner of the motel site, he said. Rejection of the rezoning request did not affect the use of the 150 motel rooms for studio rentals, Sigmon said. There were allegations that one or more members of the University Village group owned a former motel converted to apartments on East Central thats a hub of criminal activity and a source of complaints by neighbors. UNMs Lobo Development Corp. on Friday said it has selected Fairmount Properties of Ohio to work with on turning part of its nearby property into a restaurant/retail area.

Plantings for white corn--a regional staple--are down 22% while acreage for yellow corn--used mainly in animal feeds--is 4% higher on year. Plantings likely will drop 12% to 2.3 million hectares as the dry spell pressures growers in the main producing region in the country's west. It is a reversal of fortunes for a country that posted a record crop of 16.7 million tons last year, more than double the 7.8 million tons produced in 2016 after rains aided a recovery from the 2015-2016 drought fueled by El Nino.

Egypt's Military Arrests Ex-General, Ending His Presidential Hopes.CAIRO - Egypt's military on Tuesday arrested its former chief of staff, who was planning to run in upcoming elections against President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, accusing him of inciting against the armed forces and forgery, in what appeared to be a calculated move to push him out of the race. The move by the military did not come as a complete surprise given that the powerful military establishment would have been loath to see two of its graduates slug it out in an election contest, regardless of the overwhelming odds in favor of el-Sissi. Former prime minister and air force general Ahmed Shafiq said he did not think he was the ""ideal"" man to lead the nation after days of harsh criticism, some personal, by the pro-el-Sissi media. With Annan out of the race and possibly facing a court martial, only one serious presidential hopeful is left in the field: Prominent rights lawyer Khaled Ali. The statement said Annan would be questioned on charges of forging documents relevant to the formal end of his active service, breaching army regulations by declaring his intention to run without first clearing it with the military and inciting against the armed forces in his comments to the nation when he declared his intention to run for president earlier this month. Annan, who was chief of staff until 2012, only had an outside chance against el-Sissi, but his participation would have lit it up a race whose outcome is virtually a foregone conclusion. He also decried el-Sissi's policy of involving the military in mega infrastructure projects embarked on since 2014, saying that was to blame for what he called the ""erosion"" of the state's ability to deal with major domestic and foreign policies, including combating terror and economic woes.

A former Obama administration Justice Department official, Leon Fresco, said Trump's recent move likely would be challenged in court, given limits on a number of time children can be detained. Immigrant advocates have expressed their concern over Trump administration plans to arrest parents and other relatives who authorities believe smuggled their children into the United States. Immigrant advocacy groups said they were investigating three arrests in Texas, New Jersey, and Virginia that may involve sponsors. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a top priority and has vowed to continue a crackdown on those living in the U.S. illegally and sneak into the country. ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez revealed that the children whose sponsors were arrested would be placed with another verified relative or guardian, or under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Wendy Young, president of Kids In Need of Defense said that arresting those who come forward to sponsor unaccompanied children during their immigration proceedings, often parents are unimaginably cruel. ICE officials did not respond to questions Thursday seeking details on the number of sponsors who would be targeted or already had been arrested, or what charges would be applied.

The American Legion first acted in support of medical marijuana last summer, when it decided to put its weight behind an effort to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I drugs to allow for more research. It is much easier to conduct medical trials on drugs made from cannabis in Israel than it is in the U.S., where companies must spend several years getting approval from federal agencies to even do basic research on marijuana. As it stands now, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is required to follow all federal laws regarding marijuana use and many veterans and the American Legion have called on President Trump to support the measure. In 2016, the ever first study on licensed medical marijuana users occurred in Israel in which the study revealed that 99.6% of patients applied for the drug after conventional medications had no effect. In May, VA Secretary David Shulkin said he was open to new evidence showing marijuana could be used to treat veterans. Ryan said he's heard from veterans ""over and over and over again"" who use marijuana as an alternative to addictive opioids. The group has also requested meetings with Trump with the intention to ask him to change his administration's policy on cannabis. The report shows that even though most users benefit immensely from marijuana treatment, the cannabis also causes side effects among an overwhelming majority - 77% - of users.

America lied to us, the German-language Sddeutsche Zeitung quoted a high-ranking official as saying in a report claiming that a no spy pact between the two countries is dying a slow death in negotiation committees. I think the US needs to see the damage all this activity has done, and how much trust has been lost in Germany, Deutsche Welle quoted Philipp Missfelder, Germany's new coordinator for Transatlantic cooperation, as saying. But pressure appears to be mounting despite Merkel's repeated attempts to downplay the issue in order to protect US-German trade relations. Public pressure could spur action in the European Union parliament, where an effort to rewrite privacy laws and empower regulators to fine companies such as Google and Facebook as much as 100 million euros for handing over private information to the NSA risks running out of time before new elections in May. But as their US counterparts fight tooth and nail to avoid measures that would make any of those promises legally binding, German negotiators say crossing your fingers doesn't count in international relations.

For people who need to build up to more active balance activities or who have an injury to heal, Fraser likes a round wooden wobble board. Improving balance in motion, or agility, with drills is probably more valuable than standing still because it better mimics the balance required for sports and everyday activities, Fraser says. Fraser moves the slats, about 24 inches long, into the shape of a cross, then jumps from one space to the other for another agility drill that resembles cross-country skiing. Another exercise that demands more is to rotate through the foot in a clockwise and then counterclockwise motion, keeping part of the outside edge of the wobble board touching the floor as your foot goes around. Stepping onto and off the oval disk, forward and back and side to side are good balance drills, Fraser says. Props or balance devices like the duck walker are helpful because they are fun and challenge a body in new ways. Any balance work you do is good, even 30 seconds on each side, he says. He says that while everyone trips occasionally, the ability to react and recover without falling requires good balance.

This would be the strongest growth rate since the 3.7 percent registered in 2011, when massive state spending followed the financial crisis and the global economic downturn. The new Ifo estimate translates into a calendar-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of around 2.6 percent, Wollmershaeuser told Reuters, adding that he expected the strong upswing to carry on into 2018. Tax revenues and the states budget surplus are growing, which should improve Chancellor Angela Merkels chances of successfully concluding tricky negotiations on a three-way coalition agreement in coming days.

13742,"Second, we find that militias that were trained by states are associated with higher levels of sexual violence, which provides evidence for sexual violence as a ""practice"" of armed groups. However, analyzing all militias in armed conflicts from 1989 to 2009, we find that this argument does not account for the observed patterns of sexual violence, a form of violence that should be especially likely to be delegated by governments. Instead, we find that states commit sexual violence as a complement torather than a substitute forviolence perpetrated by militias. Rather than the logic of delegation, we argue that two characteristics of militia groups increase the probability of perpetrating sexual violence. First, we find that militias that have recruited children are associated with higher levels of sexual violence. Patterns of Sexual Violence in Recent Armed Conflicts.Journal Article - Journal of Conflict Resolution Existing research maintains that governments delegate extreme, gratuitous, or excessively brutal violence to militias. These two complementary results suggest that militia-perpetrated sexual violence follows a different logic and is neither the result of delegation nor, perhaps, indiscipline. This lends support to a socialization hypothesis, in which sexual violence may be used as a tool for building group cohesion. Do States Delegate Shameful Violence to Militias?",0,0

The hours before Lees execution were filled with appeals, even reaching the US Supreme Court, which issued a temporary stay as they reviewed his legal arguments on Thursday evening before voting 5 to 4 in favor of moving forward with the execution.

Continue Reading Below Selling 1.1 million ounces of gold in fiscal 2016, Freeport-McMoRan has a strong presence in the gold market, but the company is also a major player in the copper market. With seven mines in North America, two mines in South America, and one gold-copper mine in Indonesia, Freeport-McMoRan says it's the largest publicly traded copper producer, reporting 4.65 billion pounds of copper production in fiscal 2016. Many gold-mining stocks enjoyed plentiful gains in 2016 -- gains that have extended into the new year. Looking to the year ahead, management reiterated its expectation that it will complete a mineral reserve estimate in Q1, which has the potential to double the current proven and probable reserves at the Bald Mountain mine -- a mine that has the potential to emerge as one of the company's lifelong mines. Investors are still waiting for the company to report its fiscal 2016 earnings, but two corporate presentations in January pleased investors enough to drive shares up more than 18%. for investors to buy right now... and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold wasn't one of them! Acknowledgingstrong performance from itsits Masbate, Otjikoto, and Libertad Mines, management forecast a record year of gold production for fiscal 2016 -- approximately 13% higher than that which it reported in fiscal 2015. In all likelihood, shares also climbed through January as a result of both the rise in the price of gold and the rise in the prices of palladium, which reached a 22-month high during the month.

This is set to change, though, with its acquisition of Stillwater Mining, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.

The younger Falwell has taken a bit of a different approach than his brash and flamboyant father, keeping Liberty largely out of the national spotlight while making it a key spot for Republicans hoping to win the White House Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared his candidacy there earlier this year. Falwell had built the college only as part of his larger ministry, which included constructing a megachurch and hosting the Old Time Gospel Hour to be broadcast around the nation.

Now, its the largest university in Virginia, if you count distance learners among its ranks, ever since his son of the same name took the helm. He said while he would enjoy the aggressive activism of his father, he doesnt think it would be in the interests of furthering the school, which is his main focus. Thats a big change from the Baptist colleges humble beginnings in 1971. The Lynchburg, Va.-based school was founded by the late Jerry Falwell, who became famous in February 1999 when an article was published in the National Liberty Journal his schools paper that claimed the purple Teletubby named Tinky Winky was carrying water for the gay movement. Falwell said in an interview with the Associated Press that his fathers bold style of doing things is not my thing. However, it was his politically conservative Moral Majority that perhaps had the biggest sway of all, claiming 6.5 million members. Falwell died in 2007, and there were more than a few people who celebrated the death of a man who railed against the gay movement, claiming it was in opposition to the Bible.

Analysts are talking about an iPhone ""super cycle,"" which could spur a massive number of upgrades and return Apple to growth. The odds of Apple coming up with another device on par with the iPhone are vanishingly small, for the simple reason that the iPhone has been such a massive outlier in the consumer electronics industry. Getting into original content is going to be expensive, and while Apple certainly has deep pockets, I don't see a clear competitive advantage for the company.

(Jonathan Olley/Lucasfilm Ltd.) LOS ANGELES The holiday spirit is strong with Rogue One, as the Star Wars spinoff continued its stranglehold on the box office for the second consecutive weekend. Sonys Passengers, the sci-fi adventure starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt, earned an estimated $2.8 million Saturday, likely bringing its box-office take to around $22 million for the four-day weekend. Oscar contender Fences, the adaptation of the acclaimed August Wilson play thats directed by and stars Denzel Washington, entered wide release on Sunday. Passengers and Assassins Creed, two high-profile live-action efforts that debuted this weekend, proved to be no match at the box office for Rogue One. Rogue One took in around $14 million Saturday, placing it on a trajectory to potentially rake in $105 million during the four-day holiday weekend to bring its likely domestic total to well over $300 million since its Dec. 15 release. Other notable limited releases include Martin Scorseses religious epic Silence, starring Andrew Garfield, and Mark Wahlbergs Patriots Day, about the Boston Marathon bombing. Through Sunday the animated film had brought in an estimated $33.17 million, putting it on track to earn around $51 million through Monday and over $71 million since its Wednesday release date. The R-rated romp is on track to earn around $14.3 million for the four-day weekend, looking to provide comedic holiday counterprogramming for adult audiences.

After a news conference Wednesday on new state laws aimed at protecting abused children, the nation's only Latina governor said she strongly disagreed with Trump's comments that have drawn criticism across the country. The comment struck many as insensitive, and Univision's decision last week to back out of televising Miss USA and break off its business ties with Trump led to a cascade of others following suit, including the Macy's department store chain. Martinez said she hadn't been keeping up with Trump, but expressed shock after learning about comments he made during his presidential campaign announcement. Macy's, for example, said in a statement the retailer is disappointed and distressed by Trump's remarks and it would no longer carry a Trump menswear line. In addition, Martinez has gone on a number of trade missions to Mexico and has been pushing for more infrastructure at the booming border town of Santa Teresa.

After a July tragedy that left 30 migrants dead, migrants testified to Sicilian police that the organizers of the trip had forced African passengers who pay less for their passage into the hold to cram more people onboard.

1371,"In fact, in writing the unanimous decision for the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that beneficiaries of an inherited (or beneficiary) IRA did not deserve bankruptcy protection because the assets could be used for anything they wished: nothing about the inherited IRAs legal characteristics would prevent (or even discourage) the individual from using the entire balance of the account on a vacation home or sports car immediately after her bankruptcy proceedings are complete she wrote. While a spouse might argue that the money his wife was saving in her 401(k) was meant to benefit both of them in retirement, there is no way a non-spouse beneficiary could make a case for this. Although even non-spouse beneficiaries get protection from creditors if they live in a state that protects inherited retirement assets from creditors, they can bet that bankruptcy attorneys will use the Clark decision to argue otherwise. In fact, in light of the Supreme Courts unanimous decision, Morrow says individuals who want to leave sizeable retirement accounts to non-spouse beneficiaries, should not name them directly on the beneficiary form. So, even if a deceased spouses retirement account is rolled into an IRA titled in the surviving spouse's name, that doesn't guarantee safety from creditors unless he or she lives in one of seven states (Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas) that have laws giving inherited IRAs the same bankruptcy protection as IRAs titled in the name of the original owner. (1) This enables her to access the money in the IRA without having to pay a 10% penalty in case she has to make a withdrawal before she is 59. As a result, Morrow cautions those that live in a state such as California or Maine, even a rollover IRA could be subject to creditors in bankruptcy. If You Cant Roll It, Youre Toast Heres a critical point to understand: A spouse is the only individual who can inherit retirement assets, move them into a new account and name himself or herself as the new owner.

5941,"ADVERTISEMENT Mathews who at a previous hearing had indicated he wanted the dogs sent to a pit bull shelter so they could be saved signed the disclaimer after talking it over with Clark for a few minutes. Walker, when asked by reporters following the hearing if the case could have been resolved in this manner long ago, said he thought he and Picard had a good argument showing that Mathews was the owner of the dogs. Clark, before putting on a defense, asked Judge Ann Yalman to dismiss the charges, saying the city did not do enough to prove that Mathews was actually the owner of the pit bulls. He said that under the current statute, a human who is maimed and recovers isnt enough to find that an animal is vicious but that the same animal causing the death of a small dog is. But Walker said the citys ultimate goal was to have the two dogs put down and that was for the best regardless of what we might think of Mr. Mathews as a dog owner. Clark said Mathews did not face sanctions himself, beyond losing the dogs. The agreement also absolves Mathews of about $4,000 in fees to house the dogs in a shelter since they were taken by animal services officers from the West Alameda Street home where the attack occurred Nov. 12. She testified at Mathews trial Friday that she tried picking Lillie up to keep her away from the pit bulls. The dogs bit Stills a few times and ultimately got to Lillie and mauled the smaller dog to death. Stills came to court Friday carrying one of Lillies favorite toys, a stuffed dog, in her purse. That standard would require the dog to injure a person in such a way that it causes a high probability of death or permanent or prolonged impairment.

Unfortunately, so long as the hawkish, right-wing Likud Party controls Israeli policy and Benjamin Netanyahu is allied with Republicans who want war no matter what, there's no point continuing to pretend they're our best friends. Of course, President Obama has had enough of Republicans meddling with peace talks and he's ready to show them (and Netanyahu) that he's serious: The White House on Thursday sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's tactics during his reelection campaign, warning that they could alter U.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinian bid for statehood. Foreign aid to Israel and other countries is a tiny drop in the federal budget, but cutting those few billion dollars would still serve to show Benjamin Netanyahu and hard-liners in their government that we won't continue to allow the undermining of a peace deal or the contempt he has shown our president.

As much as it pains me to say it, perhaps our relationship with Israel should take a little time out until Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remembers which country he's in charge of. In fact, Sen. Graham has threatened to cut our funding to the United Nations should any sanctions against Iran be lifted, which is further proof that the hawks in Congress are intent on sabotaging any sort of reasonable deal between the countries.

Bogotá is full of graffiti street art that reflects Colombian politics and society.Bogot has a thriving graffiti street art scene, especially in a neighborhood called La Candelaria. That happens with street art as well, says Rivera. Its booming, so much so that graffiti street tours are a popular thing now. And then a few are full-blown murals, and to call them anything other than that would be to trivialize their standing as a true artistic piece. The pressure from that angst and turmoil created a great art scene. Its a popular theme in Colombian society, which is evident in many of the murals. Some are typical graffiti, while some are more sophisticated works of art. And art that, I might add, is entirely temporary. The most stunning of all, in our opinion, is a painting of an indigenous man by Colombian artist Guache.",0,4

They begin with, ""We believe that true dialogue can occur when all participants honor at least the following rights and responsibilities: RIGHTS Each person has the right to: RESPONSIBILITIES Each person has the responsibility to: None of this is complex. One of the sessions we have in many seminars at Poynter deals with those difficult conversations that you absolutely want to avoid. The object was to have some genuine dialogue, something that is too often missed in the workplace, including in the newsroom, where our craft is based on communicating clearly with others. Those conversations are mostly different than the group ones we had in Washington where we started with our own dimensions of diversity. In too many newsrooms there is little, if any, real dialogue. There is no doubt, as the NCCJ leaders point out, that deep, honest dialogue can be risky, especially if there is no safe environment, no adherence to the rights and responsibilities of those who are engaged in the exchange, no trust and respect. The act of sharing is not natural for many people. After some opening remarks and a panel discussion zeroing in on the responsibility of the media when it comes to diversity, the participants at this event were divided into small groups. It's not always easy to lower those barriers that keep our true feelings buried deep inside of us. If everyone honors the ground rules, it works.Try it.",0,0

Ever since the reality and cost of global warming and the dangers of greenhouse gases principally CO2 became clearer around the time of the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, nuclear power has enjoyed a renaissance. But as the 25th anniversary of Chernobyl approaches on April 26, the International Atomic Energy Agency and the World Health Organisation are being challenged by scientists and doctors citing evidence to suggest that up to 500,000 people may have already died as a result of the catastrophe, and another 30,000 people are expected to die of cancers linked to severe radiation exposure in 1986. Thats an improvement, but still nowhere near the vigorous questioning of the nuclear industry in Europe where tens of thousands show up at protests. At the root of it all is our hunger for energy the key input into our system and lives as we know it.#160; The big question is what we use to meet that need from our menu of options from the benign (wind, solar, waves, natural gas) to the dangerous (nuclear and coal).#160; Somewhere in the middle is hydro power.

There cannot be true peace if everyone is his own criterion, if everyone can always claim exclusively his own rights, without at the same time caring for the good of others, of everyone, on the basis of the nature that unites every human being on this earth. And then there was a different form of poverty: the spiritual poverty of our time; that poverty is most evident in wealthier societies and manifests itself in what Benedict XVI often called the dictatorship of relativismthe worship of the false god of me, myself and I, imposed by state power, often in the name of a misguided and coercive concept of tolerance. For that is precisely what so much of the spiritually impoverished world of radical secularism and lifestyle libertinism now denies: that there is any human nature which public policy and law must respect.

Second, with a technology like Restless Bandit that surfaces resumes for you, you won't have to spend as much time sifting through applicants. First, there is the aforementioned fact that these candidates already know about your company and have expressed their desire to work for it. Because Restless Bandit skips this information which can indirectly give clues about a candidate's gender, ethnicity, religion, or other demographic characteristics the technology is able to surface qualified candidates regardless of personal details.

CONFIDENCE Under the plan, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund could put in another 1 billion euros, while a consortium of banks would try sell shares for the remainder in the market but without underwriting the issue, a senior banking source said. Another source said no decision would be taken before the ECB formally communicates its rejection of the bank's request for an extension, which should happen early this week. As Monte dei Paschi's board met on Sunday, a source close to the board said the fact that Gentiloni had been asked to form a government gave the bank confidence it could still pull off the privately funded capital raise. Italy's third biggest lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena was scrambling on Sunday to thrash out a last-ditch plan to raise 5 billion euros ($5.28 billion) on the market by year-end after the European Central Bank refused to give it more time to recapitalize. Monte dei Paschi, which fared the worst in European stress tests this summer, had asked the ECB for a three-week extension to Jan. 20 to raise the money it needs to avert collapse because of the political turmoil unleashed by Renzi's resignation. Rome is ready to intervene with an emergency decree to rescue the bank if needed, a government source said on Friday. The source added the bank had been in contact with Consob since Friday to discuss the reopening of the debt swap, a politically sensitive move that could expose the lender and the market watchdog to accusations of bending the rules.

Continue Reading Below If China were to join the Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), it would potentially open $100 billion of government contracts to foreign competition every year, and offer opportunities ranging from building highways to running data networks. The United States and European Union have found China's past offers of terms for access unacceptable, with Beijing disappointing existing members of the GPA over the amount of business it was ready to throw open. The United States and China agreed in July to restart stalled negotiations on an investment treaty, with Beijing dropping previous efforts to protect certain sectors of its economy from the start. The United States is engaging in more detailed discussions with China about the requirements of the bilateral investment treaty, Froman said, adding that he could not give a timetable. The lack of market access for American firms in China is a major sticking point in trade relations with the United States. China and the United States began negotiations on a pact to govern bilateral investment in 2008, but discussions were put on hold after President Barack Obama took office the following year. China also agreed to enhance the protection of trade secrets through a high-level action plan and ease market entry barriers by removing regulatory hurdles in the country's product testing rules, Froman said. Hitherto, China has resisted calls to include procurement by local governments, which account for 93 percent of total procurement spending, saying it was up to those local governments to decide. Lack of access has been a sticking point with trade partners since China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) 12 years ago. But he added: ""It's certainly something that is",1,3

Also, WikiLeaks was turned into a strong, secure system not by Assange, the book alleges, but by the mysterious architect, whom Domscheit-Berg described as the real in-house genius. This belief in transparency is a great turn-around from their early days at WikiLeaks, a time when Domscheit-Berg says he and Assange lied a great deal. Domscheit-Berg writes that when WikiLeaks was headquartered in Iceland one of Assanges greatest fears was that the people who knew him would talk about him behind his back. (The idea that a sole hacker could break what was likely an NSA-approved military encryption is far-fetched, but one should note that Assange was convincing enough to make a believer of The New Yorker.) If what Domscheit-Berg says is true, then for the foreseeable future WikiLeaks will be unable to accept new documents that arent either handed to the website physically or mailed to it. It must be remembered that Inside WikiLeaks is written by a man who admits to lying a great deal and who claims that the principal character of his book, Assange, is an arch-liar. However, the final straw wasnt personal betrayal, but that the author came to the conclusion that Assange had lost sight of WikiLeaks mission. Assange spreads tales about his own genius, implying he can fix, or break into, just about anything, but according to Domscheit-Berg hes only a reasonably talented, rather adventurous hacker. A perceptive reader might suspect that, if these two men used high-end encryption protocols and locked up documents as well, it may be that the WikiLeaks system must be rebuilt from the ground up, and that some leaked data will be forever lost to the site.

10125,"Gallup: Obama's Average Approval Rating Ranks Near Last - Lower Than Nixon's.According to Gallup, over the course of his hideous eight years, former-President Barack Obama (my four favorite words after Nude Live! People like Obama, even if his handling of the economy was the biggest failure in history. No less than Richard Nixon, a president who resigned in disgrace, beat Obama with an average job approval rating of 49%. Why Obama left on a high note probably has to do with a mixture of nostalgia, the wonderfully nasty 2016 presidential election (which he mostly floated above), and his personal charisma. In Gallup's polling history, which covers 12 presidents reaching all the way back to Harry Truman, Obama ranks a dismal 9th. By July of last year -- after almost 8 years of Obama's war on police and the calculated race riots that followed -- 69% of Americans said race relations were bad, the highest level since the Rodney King riots. Before the first black president took office, 68% of Americans believed race relations were very or somewhat good; that included 70% of whites and a majority, 64%, of blacks. Everyone else is above 50%, with John Kennedy (70.1%) and Dwight Eisenhower (65%) enjoying the top two spots. Other than his dismal economy, the reasons for Obama's near record low average approval rating are just as obvious. Obama never wanted to be president of all the people. When you audaciously pit Americans against one another along racial, economic, gender, and religious lines, you are not going to pop over 50%.

Michelle Obamas ancestors come from South Carolina; her grandfather was part of the great migration north to Chicago. The White House Historical Association lists several of the slaves on that historic construction crew: Tom, Peter, Ben, Harry and Daniel, three of whom were slaves owned by White House architect James Hoban. The first African-American elected president of the United States had visited his soon-to-be residence, a house built by slaves.

So, if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office, who it didnt violate their conscience so they could follow the law in the state of Kentucky. Months after the Kentucky clerk was found in contempt of court and jailed for refusing to comply with court orders in favor of marriage equality, Fox News anchor Chris Wallace and debate moderator asked Christie about his earlier remarks insisting Davis should comply with the law, or be moved to another job.

Heres the problem with whats going on around the world: The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us, and the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty, Christie said.

Laiki Bank customers are also reported to be facing the loss of 80 per cent of their deposits above the 85,000 limit. Another 40 per cent will be repaid only if the bank does well in future, while 22.5 per cent will go into a contingency fund that could be subject to further write-offs.

9469,"Identifying drugs as the main cause behind Taliban advances absolves the U.S./NATO of their own responsibility in fomenting the insurgency: Their very presence in the country, as well as their destructive attacks on civilians account for a good deal of the recent increase in popular support for the Taliban. Impunity for drug lords and warlords continues: a U.S. Senate report noted in August that no major traffickers have been arrested in Afghanistan since 2006, and that successful prosecutions of significant traffickers are often overturned by a simple bribe or protection from above, revealing counternarcotics efforts to be deficient at best. Europeans are thus the main source of funding for the Afghan drug industry and their governments share a significant part of responsibility for failing to decrease demand and provide more treatment services within their own borders. Although this is pitched as a significant increase, the Taliban play a more minor role in the opium economy than UNODC would have us believe and drug money is probably a secondary source of funding for them. To blame corruption and criminals for the state of affairs is to ignore the direct and predictable effects of U.S. policies, which have simply followed a historical pattern of toleration and empowerment of local drug lords in the pursuit of broader foreign policy objectives, as Alfred McCoy and others have documented in detail. Although the report will be publicized by many as a vindication of calls to target the opium economy in order to weaken the Taliban, the authors themselves are not convinced of the validity of this argument. No: The report specifies that it does not appear to have a direct role in the Afghan opiates trade, although it may participate in low-level drugs and/or arms smuggling along the Pakistani border. Instead, the remaining 75% is captured by government officials, the police, local and regional power brokers and traffickers in short, many of the groups now supported (or tolerated) by the United States and NATO are important actors in the drug trade.

SEC seeks BernCo Treasurer records..................................................................................................................................................................................... Federal regulators this week ordered Bernalillo County to turn over financial and investment documents kept by the Treasurer's Office. The subpoena, they say, seeks documents going back to roughly 2009, covering the tenure of County Treasurer Manny Ortiz and his predecessor, Patrick Padilla. His and Padilla's work had helped earn the county tens of millions in investment income over the years, he said, and the county should have waited out the market longer rather than engage in a ""fire sale."" The restructuring of the investment portfolio was itself a response to a report by outside consultants and concerns among county commissioners that the Treasurer's Office had tied up too much of the county's cash in long-term investments that were losing value. County officials say the subpoena from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission comes after the county sold investments at a $17 million loss in 2014 to avoid the possibility of even steeper losses and to ensure there was enough cash on hand to pay bills. The subpoena is a ""fact-finding inquiry,"" not notice of any particular enforcement action, said Robert Kidd, ethics compliance officer for Bernalillo County.

According to the Financial Times: Starbucks' profits were boosted by the one-off effects of real estate transactions and the purchase of joint venture operations, but its results underlined its status as one of the consumer companies not suffering from the economic gloom afflicting so many Americans. According to the Wall Street Journal: Like the rest of the industry, Starbucks has been battling rising coffee costs and a struggling economy, but it has shown more resilience than many of its competitors, as consumers remain loyal to the brand despite the regular, modest menu price increases. Starbucks' fourth-quarter profit up 29 percent.Starbucks Corp.?s profits increased 29 percent in the three months leading up to Oct. 2, the company said today. ""What we're offering at the premium level is really resonating well with customers, despite what's still a tough environment,"" Chief Financial Officer Troy Alstead told Bloomberg Businessweek. Starbucks said it plans to open 800 new cafes worldwide in fiscal 2012, including 150 in China, Marketwatch reported. Currently, Starbucks runs 10,900 stores in the US and about 6,000 overseas, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. Sales for the quarter reached a record $3 billion, the Financial Times reported. The company said its growth strategy also includes reviving sales of its bagged coffee and tea in grocery stores and cracking the single-cup coffee market through sales of its Via instant coffee packets and its new K-Cup portion packs for Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc.?s Keurig machine, Marketwatch reported.",0,2

And while Hill and Dudley have been lauded by many for their stance, the Twittersphere is lousy with insultsremarkably creative ones, like Grant Hill is gay. Thats Grant Hill and Jared Dudley of the Phoenix Suns, lending their voices to a spot produced by the Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, or GLSEN. Ive been a big proponent of gay marriage for a long time, because as a black person, I cant be in for any form of discrimination at all, Sir Charles recently told a DC#160;sports-talk radio station. This is new territory for American pro sports, considering how an anti-gay tenor still pervades in US arenas and stadiums. Atlanta Braves pitching coach Roger McDowell was recently suspended by Major League Baseball for using similar language to harass fans in the stands. And if a pure argument for human equality doesnt motivate listeners, Barkley said, then maybe they should honor that highest of all sports values, judging folks by their athletic merit: their ability to box out, rather than their decision to come out. Daryl Presgrave, the interim communications director at GLSEN, says the group was approached by the NBA#160;last year, and the resulting partnership is vital in reaching an important demographic: boys. When the NBA opportunity came about, we were thrilled, because this would allow us to get the message in front of millions of young men. Still, Presgrave hopes a full-court press by organizations like GLSEN, along with the recent media spotlight on LGBT bullying, will effect a big-time transition.

589,"When Human Rights Watch conducted a study of the meatpacking industry they found that workers who tried to form trade unions and bargain collectively were spied on, harassed, pressured, threatened, suspended, fired, deported or otherwise victimized for their exercise of the right to freedom of association They also found that many companies took advantage of workers immigration status and lack of knowledge of their rights in the US to deny them their rights as workers. As Midnight Noters and Friends point out, US neoliberal policies open the global economy to the free entry and exit of foreign capital which results in the decline of income for most workers and the use of force and repression, especially in some countries where the workers are already impoverished (See: midnightnotes.org/). We need to advance another exceptionalist argument: that the national borders of the US and other western countries should be open to people who are without rights in their own countries in part because of the neoliberal economic and military interventionist policies and practices of western countries. Although undocumented workers are of many colors and creeds, and, although more than half of the undocumented workers in the US are not from Mexico, and about a quarter are not even from Latin America, the image that is most often portrayed in the media of an undocumented worker is that of a brown person. The idea that undocumented immigrants are criminals is a pernicious one; it portrays US citizens as dignified human beings with full political and economic rights, and immigrants as undignified others who do not deserve very much at all. Some of the US government proposals being debated suggest extending the guest worker program, which has a long record of violations of labor rights and standards, including blacklists and deportations of workers who protest. The creation of a temporary worker program that permits workers to come to the US only to work for low wages and no benefits, and does not permit them to bring their families, to send their children to school, and to form communities is not a program that should receive our support. What these reform bills are missing is a recognition that undocumented immigrants are not in the United States simply because they chose to break US law and cross borders. Although clearly it",1,1

The article No More Free Parking In Las Vegas -- Why MGM Resorts Is Taking This Gamble Opens a New Window. Furthermore, there are likely to be comp parking vouchers provided for visitors that are staying or playing at the MGM casino resorts, or players that get rewards for being MGM ""M Life"" special rewards members. ""When gambling was the be-all and end-all to our business models,"" says MGM CEOJim Murren, ""we gave away anything we could to increase the gambling revenue, including cheap rooms and cheap food."" The added revenue will also help fund a new 3,000-spot parking structure that MGM will build near its Excalibur resort to serve a new mega-arena opening later this year. Advertisement MGM is gambling that most visitors are unlikely to change vacation plans for a few dollars of parking cost savings, which I believe to be true. The site was recently updated though to announce that beginning in April, MGM Resorts will charge at all of its strip resorts. MGM understands better than any company that times are changing in Vegas, and that gambling is less important than ever. But that's about to change as MGM Resorts International announces plans to start charging for parking at its resorts in April. Even more importantly, it may encourage more visitors to opt into an MGM loyalty program or to stay at one of its hotels in order to earn free parking.

13158,"The judge who does so will have to think about this strange twist: Does the name Spike TV violate Spike Lees right of publicity, despite the fact that there are many connotations to the name Spike, of which his name is only one of the most prominent? Whether hell win his somewhat unusual suit is another matter, but Lee shouldnt be blamed, or mocked, for trying to protect an image that is, in a way, as much one of his creative works as is each of his films. But in fact, the suit may have some merit, and for this reason, Spike TV will be foolish if it fails to seriously consider choosing a new name. On the other hand, an argument that the movie Heathers violated the right of publicity of Heather Locklear would have been extremely unlikely to succeeddespite the fact that she might well have been the first Heather to come to mind. Given these affiliations, it isnt entirely unlikely that some viewers might believe, or at least wonder, if Spike Lee might be the man behind Spike TV. Indeed, Lee was smart to sue now, because the defendants still have time to change Spike TVs name, and the corresponding advertising, before its launch later this month. Thus, if someone takes your non-newsworthy photo on the street, and uses it in a pure advertising campaign, you may be able to capture their profits even though your picture never appeared anywhere but in a family album before. A lesser celebrity than Lee, and, indeed, an ordinary person may also sue to vindicate his or her right of publicity. An Apparent Admission of Intent to Capitalize on Lees Reputation The most devastating fact in Lees favor is this: Hecht apparently admitted in interviews that Spike Lee was one of his major inspirations for his choosing the name Spike TV. But whats unusual about Spike Lees right of publicity claim is that it isnt crystal clear that it is actually his name, in particular, that is being appropriated. It might seem that Lees suit is simply an act of hubrisan attempt to virtually copyright the name Spike. In sum, if Lees right of publicity claim fails, it might be for a very",1,1

11903,"ADVERTISEMENT The most notable comes in a clip in which Scott Foval, national director at Americans United for Change, tells of hiring people to demonstrate and even start fights at Donald Trump rallies. In it, he instructs his fellow lefties how to handle conservatives: In general our strategic goal with people who have become conservative activists is not to convert them that isnt going to happen. Neither the mainstream media, nor Republicans, have sufficiently exposed these dirty tricks and their intent to swing elections toward the Democratic candidate. George Soros has long funded various groups who engage in similar tactics of disinformation, even violent behavior. OKeefes videos purport to show Democratic activists, allegedly hired by the party, describing tactics they use to deceive the public. Thats probably because the resultant free-for-alls fit the left-leaning medias narrative about Trump. The objective was to encourage the media to treat the disturbances as spontaneous responses to Trumps rally rhetoric, which some lefties called hate speech. Another of OKeefes videos is of Robert Creamer, an Alinskyite from Chicago, an experienced community organizer and a man who, according to Breitbart News, visited the White House 340 times and on 42 of those occasions met with President Obama. Predictably, the media, especially CNN, which gave the disturbances nonstop and repetitive coverage, bought this narrative and willingly spread it without investigating the background of the disruptors. Federal authorities from the compromised FBI, to higher ups in the Justice Department wont do anything about it either, mostly because they back Hillary Clintons presidential candidacy. Among several tricks, Segretti composed a fake letter on Muskies letterhead falsely alleging that Sen. Henry Scoop Jackson, D-Wash., had fathered a child with a 17-year-old girl.

5894,"VIDEO: 'Days of Revolt': Chris Hedges, Detroit Activists Describe the Death of the American City.In this weeks episode of teleSURs Days of Revolt, Chris Hedges and two Detroit activists, Darryl Waistline Mitchell and Roshaun Harris, trace Detroits socio-economic apocalypse, which has taken forms specific to that city but also mirrors other communities around the country. Harris describes the presence of troops in cities like Detroit as almost like a foreign occupying army occupying the territory thats underserved, that has not been tended to in all of the other socially necessary ways to produce vitality within that community. He also points to the many ways in which the systemic racism corroding the city is connected to Americas economic history. Like Mitchell, Harris breaks down the problems from a standpoint in which economic and racial influences are inextricably linked. On that note, Harris points out how the social contract once held out to workersstill quaintly referred to as the American Dreamis no longer available. In his opening comments, Hedges refers to the sacrifice zone that Detroit has become and calls the catastrophic changes there a consequence of unfettered, unregulated capitalism. Historically that paradigm or that problem has existed but how that represents itself today is a connection between people starting to understand how the state operates. Of the new generation of young black activists and the forms and focus their protests are taking, Harris says: People are starting to see that its not just about white cops killing young black men.

For me and for thousands of families devastated by Bushs wars, this is a day to solemnly reflect upon our personal loss and on how our nation has lost its way. On this Memorial Day, I would like you to take a few moments from your day off and stare into the faces of grief. I remember seeing them the first Memorial Day after Casey was killed. I know I will never experience Memorial Day as a holiday again. We need to make Memorial Day a relic of the past. I sat with them at a ceremony and saw my future in their faces lined from years of grief and longing for the voice or the touch of a son that will never come. Seeing all the flags and the battered vets paying homage makes my stomach turn and my heart break for all the broken families that have had to pay needlessly high prices for this war, and other imperial wars, like Vietnam. Go to a nearby military cemetery and look at the American flags stuck on each grave and think of the person buried there who was killed for the greed of empire or for the blunders, greed and hubris of a nation. The flags flutter on Memorial Day as living vets from many past wars salute the flags and their fallen comrades. With a presidential election season upon us, we need to recognize the militarism of each candidate and realize that their positions on war and empire are not so different from each other.

12209,"To read The New York Times or The Washington Post, the real sporting event was whether the police would descend on Pussy Riots sideshow and could provoke Cossack goons into beating them up on camera.While there certainly was legitimate protest against former President Viktor Yanukovychs corrupt government, there was what seems provocation to get policemen (under violent attack from protesters) to defend themselves when they were fired upon by demonstrators brought into Kiev specifically to create a public relations disturbance. Now that the Ukraine promises to move under Western neoliberal tutelage, the first policies that one can expect are higher taxes on labor and consumers and an accelerated capital flight out of the country to the Eurozone and Switzerland. So the path to peace is to promote civil warfare, break up countries and concentrate wealth in as few hands as possible so as to channel it to London, New York and other financial centers rather than leaving it to be invested at home. Russia and Ukraine need to halt the capital flight of their oligarchs to offshore banking sites in places such as London and Riga, and instead mobilize their natural resources, real estate and monopoly rents for domestic investment. They have been promised that they can get even richer by paying foreign bondholders no doubt with an IMF or ECB destabilization program that will impose deep enough austerity to create an Irish-style Lost Generation. Currently, the IMF/European Central Bank wants supersede post-Soviet governments as their new central planners whose results can only accelerate kleptocratic looting! Since the USSRs collapse, the reset has been changed many times during our long-running Ukrainian play, but the underlying theme remains the same as it has been in the Near East: Play the ethnic card to break the country into pieces if you want to disable government regulatory power and investment. Breaking up countries into small units controlled by kleptocrats who see their path to wealth being to privatize public assets and sell ownership shares to the West is the most effective way of preventing government subsidy of industry and without industry there can be little military threat. It is hard to blame the new entrants for wishing NATO entry, given their past Soviet occupation. Bush (",1,1

Inequality of space#160; With 7 billion people in the world, how much space did each person get? And people who live in informal housing tend to be excluded from society, while even people who rent are often excluded from communities as those who have permanent housing see them as temporary, passing, and less invested. In this complex country of study, struggle, hope, failing infrastructure, crowded trains, and dusty Delhi streets, alcohol is often cheaper than food, and many cities in India have just one hour of water a day, with not a single city completely sewered, despite the searing summer heat. Living space, in a similar way to work space, or space on public transport, subtly communicates that some people are worth more, and have more power. Women, often spending the whole day attending to others needs (through work, family, or partners) tend to lack space where they can process the day, think, and dream. A crampled home is often a reflection of a narrow world: with poverty limiting how far people can travel, what work they can aspire to, who they meet, and what they experience.

An ICE spokeswoman, Jennifer Elzea, said that the contracts for the 2,400-bed facility in Dilley and one for a 532-bed family detention center in Karnes City, Tex., given to another company, are unique in their payment structures because they provide a fixed monthly fee for use of the entire facility regardless of the number of residents.

Business groups from around the state have also pushed for both the capital outlay bill and tax package to be approved in a special session, saying the measures would help create jobs.

Would one know that in recent years the United States has been charged by the UN and also by human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch as tolerating torture in prisons in many states, by methods ranging from solitary, 23-hour a day confinement in concrete boxes for years on end, to activating 50,000-volt shocks through a mandatory belt worn by a prisoner?

Would one know that since the Second World War many nations France during the Algerian uprising, Britain in the war in Northern Irelandhave been convulsed by furious debates about the issue of torture; or that one of the darkest threads in postwar US imperial history has been the CIAs involvement with torture, as instructor, practitioner or contractor?

Yet, although it is widely understood that the major actors in the global drama are companies, banks, and workers busy obliterating national boundaries, the analysis of the international political economy-both popular and academic-is largely focused on the relationships among nation-states. They raise the intriguing possibility that had it not been for a conscious, business-financed political strategy to change the ruling economic paradigm, the history of the last twenty years in these three countries-and perhaps elsewhere-might have been different. Even if you do not agree with that particular assessment, it is hard to argue that the determination of winners and losers from the creation of a continental economy does not have to be examined through a continental, as well as a national, lens. Both books also bring important information and insights into the evolving cross-border class politics that lies under the radar screen of the debate over globalization.

Most of this huge sum isnt the normal kind of corporate tax loss, in which a company doesnt have to pay tax until its earned enough to cover previous losses. Trumps failure to lead or sacrifice, combined with his boasting about ducking taxes (which sticks us taxpayers with the bill), is the lesson I take from the Trump tax saga.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Spokane, seeks to overturn a March 2016 decision by the Department of Agriculture to revoke regulations requiring imported meat products to be labeled with their country of origin. The lawsuit said the change violated the nations Meat Inspection Act, which required that slaughtered meat from other countries be clearly marked.

Its clear from the final two chapters of the book, one of them titled Leias Lap Dance, that Fisher published this book with making money in mind. However, many Star Wars fans will read this book anyway or likely did so the instant it appeared. Excellent, here we go, any solid fan of the real Star Wars movies (certainly not the prequels) will think, settling in for the literary equivalent of an ice cream sundae of the more offbeat flavors. But Fisher, who accepts that she will be known as Princess Leia until the end of time, lets the reader down.

Wes Kremer, integrated defense systems president for defense contractor The Raytheon Company, told the governors that training and hiring is important, but attacks will occur and cyber systems need resilience built in at the outset to repel attacks. Cybersecurity concerns are spread over many different committees, and there has been reluctance to give up jurisdiction to allow for the creation of such a committee, McAuliffe said.

10608,"Rael said alternatives to the proposed 15 percent pay raise might be to require all new police hires to live within 15 miles of Santa Fe, or to end the take-home car policy for new recruits. I believe the city needs to make some effort to make the city of Santa Fe more attractive for officers who come in but a pay raise would be problematic, he said. Officers would have to live within the corporate limits of the city of Santa Fe to qualify for a pay bump, according to the resolution. Rael also said the city should consider raising salaries for new police officers to increase Santa Fes competitiveness in hiring. Chief Wary Of Pay Hike..................................................................................................................................................................................... Rael told the citys Public Works Committee the pay raise could create morale problems and other issues in the Police Department. The measure may also lead to scaling back the police departments vehicle take-home policy, which allows officers to commute up to 60 miles each way between work and home using their patrol cars and city-paid fuel. For the average rookie police officer, who earns about $38,958 annually, the 15 percent live in Santa Fe incentive would mean an extra $5,843 or so a year. Rael told the Public Works Committee around 64 percent of police officers currently live within 15 miles of Santa Fe. Rather, they would be put into the budget for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1, and city managers would negotiate details with the police union. ADVERTISEMENT Rael said compaction has resulted from pay raises lower-ranking officers receive through their union-negotiated contracts. The proposed resolution refers to implementing a mileage distance of 15 miles for new commissioned police personnel to take home police vehicles. The increase could also worsen the departments salary compaction issues, Rael said.",0,0

12996,"Oil Prices Chase $60 After a Year of Surging Demand--2nd Update.Oil prices have risen to levels not seen since June 2015, as unexpectedly strong global growth has driven demand and helped soak up a supply glut that has plagued the market for years. While investors have become more optimistic about the possibility of supply cuts, global demand was the surprise factor that pushed oil prices higher than expected, said Darwei Kung, portfolio manager of the $2.7 billion Deutsche Enhanced Commodity Strategy Fund. ""We are more optimistic on oil demand growth given the ongoing solid global growth momentum and the still relatively low oil prices,"" they wrote in a note Monday, reiterating their forecast. ""But with oil prices low and the global economy strengthening, we had another great demand year,"" he said. Increased demand has pulled stockpiles of crude oil out of storage this year, even as U.S. shale producers have ramped up output and pushed weekly production to record highs. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a research note Nov. 9 that rising consumption, especially in India and China, prompted the bank to boost its forecast for global demand -- Goldman analysts now expect it will increase by 1.7 million barrels a day this year from 2016. In a fresh sign that big oil companies are recovering and see prices stabilizing, Royal Dutch Shell PLC said Tuesday it would begin paying its dividend only in cash, scrapping a program that gave shareholders the option of receiving dividends in discounted stock, known as a scrip. Low prices in 2015 and 2016 fueled ""scorching"" increases in consumption and some weren't sure whether that would continue, said Doug Terreson, head of energy research at Evercore ISI. Oil's recent rally may also be threatened by a meeting this week between OPEC and other global producers including Russia. In recent months, increased geopolitical tensions in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq sent oil prices higher, which analysts noted as a sign of a tighter market supply. Also, strong factory activity in China has boosted copper -- a widely watched barometer of global economic health -- to near a three-year high. ",1,3

They were at least discussing and pursuing strategies for carrying over from Iran to Iraq this same operation of giving nuclear weapons plans to a country that as far as they knew didn't have any, with mistakes introduced that as far as they knew were obvious, and that their own team of scientists had saw their way around and successfully created the parts based on the plans.

SWANSON: Well you know, the official story, and the story that was presented to the all-white jury that convicted Jeffrey Sterling is that this was an approach to Iran to slow down its nuclear weapons program. And the CIA took the photos down off its website, but you can still see them, that look very much in common with what was given to Iran. And yet on the basis solely of that metadata, and a lot of smoke and mirrors and talk about the grandeur of the CIA, they got a jury to convict Jeffrey Sterling. Jeffrey Sterling went to the relevant committee of Congress that has oversight and has the authority to review these things, and reported to them what was going on with Iran. But we know that there were teams of special operations, plans, officials running about Iraq right after the invasion, trying to find if not plant weapons of mass destruction.

And in the case of Oil for Food contract abuses, as the saying goes, it takes two to tango. If, as a consequence of the Iraq mess, the US becomes more averse to intervening militarrily, sanctions will again become a major foreign policy tool.

8301,"To the Dogs: China’s New Passion for Pets Is Big Business.Shanghai bank employee Frances Chen spends about a fifth of her monthly salary on her poodle Cookie, one of the millions of pet owners turning China's pet care industry into one of the fastest growing in the world. Dogs are by far the most popular pets and dog food sales alone are expected to almost triple to over $760 million by 2019, Euromonitor data shows, as higher disposable incomes make keeping a pet an affordable luxury for more Chinese, particularly in more developed cities. ""In big cities like Shanghai, many people feel lonely and treat pets like family,"" said pet groomer Zhao Huanhuan. The loneliness and stress endemic to city life are also driving the pet ownership boom: last year, some 30 million households, or nearly 7 percent of the nationwide total, owned a dog, Euromonitor said. Once banned by Communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong as a bourgeois pastime, having a pet has now become a symbol of financial success in China, where consultants Euromonitor forecast the pet care sector to grow by more than half to 15.8 billion yuan ($2.6 billion) by 2019, outpacing the world's biggest market the United States, which is expected to grow just over 4 percent this year to $60.6 billion. In addition to branded food, more Chinese are paying top yuan for pedigree dog breeds such as Tibetan mastiffs, and the services and accessories they think these prized pets deserve. ""There is huge demand for pet food as owners give up feeding their dog rice and meat and switch to proper pet food,"" Chen Xiuqiang, sales manager at pet food importer and distributor Guangzhou Mudi Trading Co Ltd told Reuters.

He is probably best known for this one time in which he killed throngs of Nazis in a manner closely resembling the climactic scene in the movie The Wild Bunch.

Usually, by moving strategically into other sites, it allows the corporate church as a whole to continue to grow while adding other meeting sites. The congregation started a second campus near Kansas City International Airport to help church members reach friends and relatives in that area who would not drive out to the main campus. One grew out of a previous ministry in a mobile home park combined with a group of about 10 to 15 Hispanics meeting in a room at the churchs oldest campus on Buford Road. The second site has been able to break down barriers of ethnicity and economics much more than members would have been able to do at the main campus, Cason said. Ministry Some churches use the multicampus model as a way to meet specific needs. Sustain growth One reason multisite churches often are synonymous with megachurches is size. But as it has developed, the church-growth model has taken on many forms to serve a variety of purposes and ministry contexts. Conjoined congregations are multisites that meet simultaneously, sharing the same preacher and worship experience from one live site with a video or Skype link. Broadview Baptist Church in Abilene set up a second site in a trailer park of highly mobile, lower-income families.

In his first speech to a joint session of Congress Trump embraced a key element of the emerging House GOP health plan, in comments that cheered Republican House leaders and could help bring conservatives back in line.

250,"This replacement of democratic rule with a single personality and his minions, an event too sadly represented throughout history, does not seem to trouble a great many people who see themselves as oppressed by personal freedom restraints imposed by gentrifying, secularized, politically correct Liberals whom they despise. We could say at this point that however much many might fear what derangement in the White House might do to the country, the bitter loathing of the Liberal politically correct, socialist leaning Elite trumps what the Trump regime might do. The Fourth Estate was not framed to see what drove Trump to power because the reality frame of the press emerges from a Western Tradition of Rationality and Realism oriented toward reason and its demonstration of what is real and true. A Melville type confidence man with a net worth he wont reveal but has his own name as a profitable brand, and who makes contact with people on a very real level because of a long stint on Reality-TV, turns out to be exactly suited to a populace much admiring fame and fortune while also being deeply mired in spin and spectacle and increasingly detached from any view of the truth and how to reach it beyond their own gut inspired opinions. And just as the Trump faction abides within a phenomenal reality so too does the Fourth Estate, ensnared within a Western Tradition of Rationality and Realism that has been under attack since a post-truth paradigm, unhelpfully termed postmodernity, put under interrogation that tradition and exposed what Jacques Derrida called a white mythology of reasoning and realizing. This is a clash that we now see has unsettled and infuriated President Trump and so he is making every effort to close all portals from his boardroom, now the Oval Office, to the Fourth Estate, the conduit of information vital to an electoral democracy to its citizens. It is, however, #160;the Fourth Estate, most directly the legacy press, and not the many rabid ranting outlets and echo chamber media in cyberspace, which must bring to light the warfare now underway between the Trump regime and those institutions and branches of government opposing its fascist direction.

13245,"For many grad students, the very idea of a contract governing the limits and conditions of our labor is a source of skepticism and even derision. As minter of this coin, the university holds its subjects in a state of blind dependency: students compete for the attention of a shrinking pool of professionals (part-time instructors currently outnumber tenure-track faculty by a ratio of four to one), while the latter scurry to commodify the drippings of a hive-mind on the brink of colony collapse. Labor is the fate of the unlucky, the future-less, the un-special of all who fail admittance to the academy, or who find themselves passed over in the competition for grants, honors, and jobs. Those who do not support the strike will claim that grad students are not workers at all, but rather professionals in the chrysalis stage of a post-laborious life cycle. A population that does not recognize itself as working will not mind working harder, longer, and more obediently, whatever the personal cost. The ideology of grad school rationalizes this deficit as the price of shelter from the working world, of which the academy is surely the opposite. Although particular grievances differ from campus to campus, in aggregate, they concern the universitys unwillingness to bargain over key aspects of our employment, including class size and the number of terms (quarters, semesters) students are able to work.

Even experts within the administration recognize that free trade in oil could benefit American consumers and create U.S. jobs, API Executive Vice President Louis Finkel said. As expected, the House passed a bill to end the governments ban on the exportation of American oil by a vote of 261-159. However, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, gasoline prices would be left unchanged or even decline in the event that exports get a green light. U.S. production, particularly growth in shale plays, contributed to a global supply glut, and oil prices have been cut in half compared to their highs of 2014. He also noted the Obama administrations plan to end oil sanctions on Iran as part of a nuclear agreement. Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) argued that oil exports would create energy jobs in the U.S. and bolster national security by lessening allies dependence on oil from Russia and the Middle East. Aside from the surge in U.S. energy activity, the impact of exporting crude could be minimized because refined products and condensatea lightly processed form of oilare already eligible to be shipped out of the country.

So Chicken of the Sea appealed to the high court, which this month requested a response from Fellner, a sign that the court may be seriously considering the preemption issue raised by the tuna company. Even if she loses, shell succeed in raising public awareness about mercury in tuna simply from the publicity likely to surround the case if it reaches the Supreme Court. At the request of the tuna industry in another lawsuit, the FDA had claimed that such lawsuits were preempted by federal law because it was already doing such a good job of regulating tuna.#160; A judge agreed, and using that decision, Chicken of the Sea claimed that Fellners lawsuit was likewise trumped by federal regulators, largely because they had posting a warning about eating mercury in fish on the FDA website. Supreme Court May Hear Mercury In Tuna Case. In that case, the court found that lawsuits against the cigarette company for deceiving customers into thinking that light cigarettes were healthier for them were not preempted by federal regulations. Yet a New Jersey federal court initially threw out her case thanks to help from the Bush FDA. In February last year, in Riegel v. Medtronic, the court ruled that a 1976 law did preempt lawsuits filed against the makers of medical devices whod undergone extensive safety testing required by the FDA, even when those devices were defective and killed people. The case represented a huge win for those who see preemption as a threat to many state consumer protection, health and safety laws.

The same aggressive Dutch approach to taking for the public domain is apparent in the farms and communities taken to build a container railroad in the recent documentary The Forgotten Space.

Rigs aside, GoPro doesn't appear to be doing much else in the VR space at the moment, perhaps because it's busy trying to put out the fires from its botched release of its Karma drone Opens a New Window. It's still very early in Intel's VR push, but the company is making some smart moves in the space that could eventually help boost its chip sales. The device is only offered as a developer kit right now, but it shows that Intel is thinking of new ways to convince device makers that its chips should be at the forefront of the VR market. Considering that GoPro's only foray into virtual reality involves a rig that holds six cameras and some software that most people have never heard of, I think betting on GoPro as a VR investment is a bad idea. Considering Intel'smassive reach in the semiconductor space, its low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 17, and its ongoing push into new markets like VR, I think the company looks like a bargain compared to the other players right now. Intel appears to be already focusing on this for some of its chips, and on its website, it describes its Core i7 chip as having a ""great VR experience"" and has ""the power to deliver amazing game physics, rich 360 degree 3D visuals, precise controls, and immersive 3D sound.""

Greg Abbott also vowed to legally challenge the federal law, after announcing in November that his state would not accept any Syrian refugees. New Mexico is actually a state with very little refugee resettlement, said Matthew Soerens, a spokesman for World Relief, one of the nine resettlement agencies that help to relocate refugees from all over the world in the U.S. Last November, after the ISIS attacks in Paris, Martinez released a statement opposing President Obamas plan to accept more Syrian refugees until there is a very clear plan in place to properly vet and place the refugees, and the voices of governors and the public can be heard. Accordingly, it is my official opinion that both federal law and the States agreement to act as the state refugee resettlement coordinator prevent the State from denying federally-funded benefits to Syrian refugees lawfully admitted into the United States, Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens wrote. Specifically, the executive order attempted to stop state agencies from being involved in accepting refugees.#160; But Deal later rescinded that order after the states Attorney General released an opinionin which he said he was unaware of any law or agreement that would permit a state to carve out refugees from particular countries from participation in the refugee resettlement program, no matter how well-intended or justified the desire to carve out such refugees might be.

Of course the reason must be that the best friend should be given a scene or two of drooling over her friends supermodel roommates, but once that is accomplished the filmmakers couldnt think of anything else to do with her and dropped her quietly out of the picture. You may also find yourself hard put to it to find any other sort of fun in the movie, whose main story involves an allegedly regular gal called Amanda Pierce (Monica Potter), a conservator at the Metropolitan Museum, moving in as roommate to the supermodels. Miss Potter is hardly the girl next door, and the only way the movie finds to distinguish her from the supermodels is to deprive her of make-up (until she becomes the models science project ) and to make her look about a head shorter than they are. Some of the jokes are fair-to-middling, as when one of them says that her makeup makes her look like a heroin addict, but not in a good way. Most of humor at the beauties expense, however, depends on the assumption that those who are highly paid to look good must also be stupid, slutty, superficial or all three. Naturally, these undercover activities lead to many misunderstandings which people of the intelligence of the supermodels in this picture may find funny. Head Over Heels.True, there may not be much to be said for Head Over Heels, but one thing it can claim is that, with the scene of Freddy Prinze Jr. defecating while a gaggle of supermodels huddle together, hidden behind the shower-curtain of his bathtub, it has broken new ground for the ever-poopular gross-out flick.

Verizon agreed to buy it in mid-2016 for $4.83 billion, but the deal was delayed after Yahoo's disclosure of the two large hacks, plus a third incident in which hackers forged digital files, called cookies, that could have been used to access 32 million user accounts. Continue Reading Below A spokesman for Oath, the Verizon unit that now includes Yahoo, said the company determined within the past week that the break-in was much worse than thought, after it received new information from outside the company. The new disclosure, four months after Verizon completed its acquisition of Yahoo, shows that executives are still coming to grips with the extent of the security problem in what was already the largest hacking incident in history by number of user accounts. In the May SEC filing, Yahoo also said it is ""cooperating with federal, state, and foreign governmental officials and agencies seeking information and/or documents"" about the incident, including the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, and two State Attorneys General.

EA Games executive vice president Patrick Soderlund said that despite the ostensibly steep price tag the online service still offered gamers savings since access to content included in the membership package would cost $25 more if it was purchased separately. Video games maker Electronic Arts is introducing a new $50-a-year games service for players of ""Battlefield 3"" as it aims to boost its online sales and gain ground against bigger rival, Activision Blizzard, which sells the top-selling title ""Call of Duty."" Gamers who buy the service on their Sony PlayStation 3 console will get to play new parts of the game two weeks earlier than non-members. EA, which recently made a big bet on one most expensive games in its history, ""Star Wars: The Old Republic"", has seen its shares tumble 36 percent since Jan 1.

It is a commentary on the state of self-deception which dominates the U.S. Command in Saigon, that before the mass bombings started General Westmoreland employed psychologists to sample public opinion in South Vietnams villages about the bombings and reported back to Washington their surprising conclusion that the peasants apparently enjoyed being bombed and had no hard feelings about the United States on this score. Even possession of such a shelter was evidence of guilt, which is why the casualties when the Americans accidentally bombed villages under Saigon control or in the disputed areas were immeasurably higher than when they bombed one in the NLF areas, where every home had its deep shelter and every village its communication trenches. There is a report from Washington in the October 13, 1965 New York Herald Tribune by columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak which states: Two bits of evidence fly in the face of all the lamentations that although U.S. bombing of villages in South Vietnam may be winning battles, it is losing the war by alienating the people. I say the most ingenious can do this without knowing a single person who is that ingenious Not only do refugee camps force these people into an existence which is marginal at best they do incalculable violence to the customs and traditions of the Vietnamese people The government has not offered a new and better life, it has only exchanged one form of terrorism for another.

It stated, The fact that a defendant acted pursuant to an order of his government or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility The reasoning for the high standard was to restrain war crimes by soldiers, whether carried out against combatants or civilians. Israeli Court Ignored Nuremberg Precedents.On Dec. 30, 2002, the Israeli Supreme Court, in Jerusalem, ruled that Army reservists, who have refused to serve in the Occupied Territories, for reasons of conscience, cannot be exempted from military duty. Unfortunately, the court ducked the main issue: Whether Israels 35 year occupation of the territories is illegal and violates international law and that the reservists have the right to refuse duty there. The Israeli court opinion refusing to exempt the Army reservists from duty in the Occupied Territories makes a mockery of justice. In it, the men said they would continue to defend Israel, but they would no longer fight in the war for the welfare of the Jewish settlements. Such objectors, referring to the petitioners, are shirking risky duty in a time of war, and also this could have security implications as the number of resisters grow. Earlier this year, more than 70 Israeli army reservists, including at least two dozen officers, stated they would no longer serve in the West Bank and Gaza because of the brutality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. The soldiers said that while serving in the occupied territories, We have received instructions that have nothing to do with the security of the state, and whose sole purpose is the perpetuation of domination of the Palestinian people.

US agencies bothered by iPhone 6 security.A number of federal agencies have expressed concern over the iPhone 6s new security measures, saying that it is becoming too difficult to eavesdrop on people for security issues. Essentially, while a security agency may have been able to force Apple to give up information in the past, those days are over. The only thing Apple will be able to hand over to authorities is encrypted data, which Apple estimates may take up to five years to crack. The new iPhone, however, comes with advanced encryption software that keeps users data safe from anyone trying to break into the device. Apple has so far declined to comment on the issue, however it seems as though the companys stance is that it needs to take care to protect the general consumers privacy. Only the user of the phone will have access to codes to access the data in fact, even Apple cant access it. Even the FBI has spoken out against Apples measures, arguing that technology could be used by terrorists to plan and implement attacks. Despite this, it is important to take the general consumers privacy into account in these issues. Many users no longer want to be subject to surveillance programs implemented by the NSA.

A few weeks ago, I wrote a story about how the families of the Deepwater Horizon explosion victims cant really sue for major damages over BPs negligence in the explosion, thanks to an ancient maritime law called the Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA). CLIA says the bill would expose it to lawsuits that could prove to be extremely unpredictable, the same line Exxon took in its many appeals of the Valdez lawsuit. Lobbying on the other side along with the BP workers families are the Parents of Murdered Children, the National Center for Victims of Crime, and the International Cruise Victims Association, which is made up of lots of families of people who went on cruises and never came back. Late Tuesday, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) sent a letter to members of the Florida congressional delegation strongly opposing the bill because it would allow cruise ship victims to sue the companies for noneconomic damages. Well, turns out the Love Boat lobby has indeed stepped up to do BPs dirty work in fighting the SPILL Act. CLIA is joined in its campaign by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which naturally is opposed to any law that might make it easier for the little people to sue big corporations that kill them. But as Kendell Carver, ICAs president, wrote on June 17 to Rep.

President Obama can not only order the work to stop, but he can also deploy the Army Corps of Engineers, or even the National Guard, to stop the violence being perpetrated by local, regional and state officials against the nonviolent protestors. Yet, it is important to realize that despite the need for much more progress for human rights, President Obama has reached out to all citizens during his two terms. The countrys first people, Native Americans, are fighting to protect their ancestral burial grounds and the drinking water for not only their people, but all people whose source of water is through the Missouri River. If the tribe had been consulted, the government would have learned that this route requires digging up sacred places, old burial grounds and Lake Oahe, but the Army Corps of Engineers approved this path under a fast track option called Permit 12.

13454,"Egypt Court Sentences 529 Muslim Brotherhood Supporters to Death.An Egyptian court handed death sentences to more than 500 supporters of the country's ousted president on Monday, lawyers said. The 529 members of the Muslim Brotherhood were accused of a deadly attack targeting police in Cairo last August. The charges relate to violence in Cairo in August, which resulted in one police officer being killed. The Muslim Brotherhood was classified as a terrorist organization by Egypt's military government after its former leader, President Mohammed Morsi, was deposed and arrested last year. The court in Minya, north of Cairo, issued its ruling after just two sessions in which the defendants' lawyers complained they had had no chance to present their case, The Associated Press reported. The riot was a backlash against a police crackdown on two pro-Morsi sit-in protests on Aug. 14. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood members have been killed in clashes with police and thousands more arrested since Morsi was overthrown. Monday's ruling came the same day as a group of Al Jazeera journalistswere due to begin their trial in Cairo on being associated with the Brotherhood. The ruling was described by Cairo-based rights lawyer Mohammed Zarie as ""way over the top and unacceptable."" In addition to the 529 sentenced to death, 16 were acquitted, lawyer Ahmed al-Sharif told Reuters after the ruling, which can be appealed. ""It turns the judiciary in Egypt from a tool for achieving justice to an instrument for taking revenge,"" Zarie told the AP. Only 123 of the defendants were present at the hearing, the rest were either released, out on bail or on the run.",0,2
5963,"The Old Get Spared, the Young Get Burdened.In my column for the National Post, I look at the causes of some recent student riots in Quebec: The rioting students of Quebec got scant sympathy even before they started smashing windows and detonating smoke bombs. When we taxed the young to support the old, we could assume we were taxing the (richer) future to support a (poorer) past. More of that tax was used to buy things they themselves consumed; less to support the retirement of the (smaller and shorter-lived) cohorts before them. As they age, the pre-1960 cohorts will enjoy more benefits from government than they themselves ever paid for. And because so many of the benefits for the pre-1960 cohorts have been (and will be) financed by debt, the pre-1960 cohorts will be drawing support from the post-1990 cohorts for years to come. Even when all the increases are phased in, Quebec students will still pay less than students anywhere else in Canada, only 17% of the cost of their own education. Members of the pre-1960 cohort paid less tax when young. Polls suggest that Quebecers generally support Jean Charest's government's plan to raise tuitions in small increments over the next five years. They will draw more support from the post-1990 cohorts than they themselves paid toward their elders. In the past, this redistribution from young to old could be justified by economic growth. It's not just that pensions and health-care spending outweigh education and college spending (although of course they do). In addition, the cohorts born before 1960 have received a better deal from government at every phase of life than will - in all likelihood - the cohorts born after 1990.",1,1

That vision includes the idea that no person should be able to mail a letter without the USPS and their pals in Homeland Security knowing about it. Tracking You Through the Mail.Next week, a special commission created by President Bush will present him with a final report on articulating a proposed vision for the future of the United States Postal Service. The Subcommittee recommends that the Postal Service, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, explore the use of sender identification for every piece of mail, commercial and retail. Consumers should be able to decide for themselves whether the risk of an insecure mail system (though something tells me those Priority Mail guarantees will remain insecure regardless) is worth the cost in privacy. Presumably if those fellows were alive in the Commissions vision for the future, they could not mail their pamphlets without a Homeland-designed mailbox snapping a few pictures and running the images through face-recognition software. With a legal monopoly and Orwellian policy, the Presidents Commission would make that impossible; for this weeks Privacy Villains would have us all scrutinized and tracked Under the Eagles Eye.

A group of former U.S. military officials also urged the Trump administration to reject solar tariffs, noting that the Defense Department is the nation's largest energy consumer and follows a federal law calling for the Pentagon to procure 25 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2025. Trade panel says low-cost solar imports hurt US companies.Low-cost solar panels imported from China and other countries have caused serious injury to American manufacturers, a U.S. trade commission ruled Friday, raising the possibility of the Trump administration imposing tariffs that could double the price of solar panels from abroad. ""We believe that the promise of solar - energy sustainability and independence - can be realized only with healthy American manufacturing to supply growing U.S. demand,"" Stein said in a statement to The Associated Press. They cited a study showing that a global tariff could cause solar installations to drop by more than 50 percent in two years, a crushing blow as states push for renewable energy that does not contribute to climate change.

(The Associated Press) I never lost my appetite for acting, Wallach wrote in his 2005 memoir The Good, The Bad, and Me, named after his most famous film. The versatile, raspy-voiced actor was a mainstay of Tennessee Williams plays (he won a Tony Award for The Rose Tattoo in 1951) and an original member of the Actors Studio in the early days of Method acting. Wallach was also great uncle to the New York Times film critic A.O.

Examining the academic transcripts of high school graduates in the 18-year period from 1998 to 2016, they found that the average grade point average (GPA) rose from 3.27 to 3.38, even as the average SAT score dropped. And heres another interesting tidbit that might lead you to wonder if standards are being lowered: a record number of students graduated from high school last year. Yet as USA Today notes: A recent study by the Harvard Graduate School of Education found that just 56% of college students complete a four-year degree within six years of entering college. According to the study conducted by Michael Hurwitz of the College Board and Jason Lee, a doctoral student at the University of Georgias Institute of Higher Education, almost half (47%) of high school seniors in 2016 had an A average, a percentage that had risen from 38.9% in 1998. Hurwitz pointed out that an A is now ""the modal high school grade, which certainly points toward grade inflation. For students who start at two-year colleges, it's even worse: Just 29% earn a degree within three years. All of that information suggests that there is widespread grade inflation being practiced across the country. The average high school graduation rate now tops 83%, according to federal statistics. He noted that grade inflation increased during the Vietnam War era so professors could ensure that students would remain in college and avoid being drafted. In that same time span, average SAT scores fell from 1,026 to 1,002 on a 1,600-point scale.

If Xiaomi struggles to sell the Mi Notebook Air within China -- theworld's biggest PC market since 2011 -- it might think twice before launching it in other markets. Xiaomi's Mi Notebook Air is an impressive-looking device, but the company could struggle to get consumers interested in laptops again. The only comparable ""gaming ultrabook"" on the market is Lenovo's Air 13 Pro, which offers nearly identical hardware as the Mi Notebook Air but just half as much RAM (4GB) for $750. Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi recently launched the Mi Notebook Air, a Windows 10 ultrabook that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) MacBook Air.

To prevent what happened to the anti-war movement under President Obama, people will need a broader understanding of the root causes of the crises we face, not the shallow analysis provided by the corporate media, and will need to understand how social movements can be effective. Role of Youth in the Coming Transformation.The eruption of youth protests over gun violence in schools and other issues is another indicator that the#160; 2020s could be a decade of transformation#160;where people#160; demand economic, racial and environmental justice#160;as well as peace. Dehumanization is required to allow mass murder, whether by a single gunman or in war, as well as the economic violence that leaves people homeless and hungry, or for the violence of denying people necessary healthcare and to pay people so little they need multiple jobs to survive. The anti-war movement faded under the Obama administration, even though he escalated US militarism, but other movements arose such as Occupy, immigrants rights, the fight for 15, Idle No More and black lives matter. As#160; Bruce Dixon writes, Its not hard to see the hand of the Democratic party behind the tens of millions in corporate contributions and free media accorded the March For Our Lives mobilization.

Ignore the apocalyptic rhetoric about Gorsuch..................................................................................................................................................................................... Like Scalia, Gorsuch understands the constitutional limits on his authority, and he knows that the duty of a judge is to apply the law evenhandedly rather than ruling with bias toward one party or another. I invite Democrats, who spent months insisting we need nine justices, to join us in following through on that advice by giving the new presidents nominee fair consideration and an up-or-down vote just as we did for past presidents of both parties. The attacks seem ridiculous today, but theyre an important reminder that no matter who a Republican president nominates, the far left will say the same things. Perhaps the great project of Justice Scalias career, Gorsuch said last year, was to remind us of the differences between judges and legislators. I maintained that position even when it seemed inevitable to many that Hillary Clinton would be making that choice. When our nation lost Scalia in the middle of a contentious presidential election, I looked to the precedent set forth by Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who when he was Senate Judiciary Committee chairman declared that Supreme Court vacancies arising in the midst of a presidential election should not be considered until the campaign ended. Of course, as history teaches, we already know that the far left will throw hyperbolic attacks at this nominee regardless of his credentials. As Biden recently implored his fellow party members, they should give the nominee a hearing and a vote. Scalia will be a tough act to follow, but Gorsuch will continue his legacy",0,0

Mike Coffman, a Republican moderate from Colorado, said he thinks it could be difficult to pass DACA reform that doesnt include other measures that appeal to congressional conservatives. Were interested in getting border security and the president has made the commitment to the American people that a barrier is important to that security, White House legislative director Marc Short said Tuesday at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast in Washington that included reporters. 12 (UPI) A White House official said Tuesday that President Donald Trump wont require funding for a border wall to be linked to a new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. On Sept. 5, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that Trump would end the program that protected undocumented children brought to the United States from deportation unless Congress finds a legislative solution in the next six months. Trump plans to disclose his goals for potential DACA reform within the next couple of weeks, Short said. Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, has likened a possible legislative link between DACA reform and border-wall funding to hostage taking.

Whether or not that is part of a DACA equation, or another legislative vehicle, I dont want to bind us into a construct that would make the conclusion on DACA impossible.

For the purposes of the Social Security earnings test, American seniors are grouped into three categories: Advertisement If you fall into the first category -- that is, you won't reach full retirement age until after the current year -- you face the stricter form of the earnings test. As a final point, it's important to mention that if your benefits are reduced because of the earnings test, they don't exactly disappear. Since $2,000 is $590 more than the earnings test threshold, your monthly Social Security checks will be reduced by half of this excess, or $295. The Social Security earnings test sets annual earnings thresholds, above which certain workers' retirement benefits can be reduced or completely withheld. For every $3 in earnings above the corresponding threshold, your retirement benefits will be reduced by $1. Rather, the withheld amount will be applied as a delayed retirement credit, which can permanently increase your retirement benefit once you reach full retirement age. If a beneficiary earns more than the earnings test threshold for their age, their Social Security benefits Opens a New Window. However, the point is that your benefits aren't lost because of the earnings test -- just delayed. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. Beyond these thresholds, every $2 in excess earnings will reduce your benefits by $1.

12551,"Smick fears damaging outcomes: currency wars as countries strive to capture greater shares of stagnant export markets; and burst asset bubbles caused by easy money. The search for larger markets and lower costs drove investment, trade, economic growth and job creation around the world. Whats unclear is whether this heralds prolonged economic stagnation and rising nationalism or, optimistically, makes the world economy more stable and politically acceptable. For years, the world economy has been wildly lopsided: China and some other countries ran big trade surpluses; the United States was perennially in massive deficit. But something remarkable is happening; trade and international money flows are slowing and, in some cases, declining. The upshot is that China and others are recalibrating their export-led economic strategies to focus more on domestic demand, argues economist Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute. Despite banks pullbacks, those same 30 emerging market countries in 2012 received an estimated $1 trillion worth of investment from multinational companies, private investors, pensions, insurance companies and other lenders a still-huge total, though down from its peak. For decades, growing volumes of cross-border trade and money flows have fueled strong economic growth. As important, it says, the United States will maintain significant cost advantages over other developed-country manufacturers: 15 percent over France and Germany; 21 percent over Japan; and 8 percent over Great Britain.

As the NED brass discussed Adelmans nomination, submitted by NED president Carl Gershman, someone distributed a Nation article reporting on Adelmans speech to a conservative conference last February [see Corn, Fear and Loathing in Washington, March 5]. Adelman had pandered to the approving claque at the Conservative Political Action Conference, suggesting that liberals are communists and describing House Speaker Jim Wright as a traitor for his work on the Central America peace plan. From a Nation magazine column (not on-line) I penned in 1988: The board of the National Endowment for Democracy recently considered the pending nomination of Kenneth Adelman, a protege of Jeane Kirkpatrick and head of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency through many of the Reagan years. Having worked with Ronald Reagan for seven years, and been with him in his critical three summits with Gorbachev, Ive concluded that thats no way a president can act under pressure. Not only is Sarah Palin not close to being acceptable in high office I would not have hired her for even a mid-level post in the arms-control agency. In fact, I once wrote about Adelmans use of extremist rhetoric, and that kept him from obtaining a spot on the board of a prominent Washington advocacy group. And whos next to disavow McCain and back Obama? But I remember the days when Adelman sounded more like the mad McCainiacs I recently encountered at a McCain rally. The slippery Gershman, himself a former aide to Kirkpatrick, listened to a tape-recording of Adelmans speech and blithely assured the NED board there was nothing disturbing on it. But one Democratic board member took the precaution of personally reviewing the tape and came away outraged by Adelmans comments.

The 1814 Star-Spangled Banner manuscript by Francis Scott Key will be displayed along with the original flag that inspired it at the Smithsonian from Flag Day, June 14, through July 6. Bonnie Lilienfeld, a Smithsonian curator who is working on the manuscripts display in Washington, said she hopes the exhibit will help people think more about where the songs words came from. The manuscript is normally on display at the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore and the flag has been at the Smithsonian since the early 1900s. When he saw the forts flag flying on the morning after the bombardment, a signal that U.S. troops had withstood the enemy, he was inspired to write a poem originally called Defense of Fort McHenry. Burt Kummerow, president of the Maryland Historical Society, said he hopes this summers exhibit will be a chance for people to study the songs words. Americans may be more familiar with the flag, which gets millions of visitors a year at the Smithsonians National Museum of American History.

Given the legislative limits GOP lawmakers face in fully repealing Obamacare and the struggles theyre having landing on a consensus ACA alternative, one could argue that the Obamacare repeal push is actually a trojan horse for the much more sweeping conversion of Medicaid, from an unlimited match rate into a system where federal funding will be limited on a per-enrollee-basis. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that 14 million people would lose their coverage due to the legislations Medicaid provisions, though its unclear how many of those are a result of the phase out of Medicaids expanded eligibility versus its transformation of the larger program into a per-enrollee block grant. States would most likely make decisions based mainly on fiscal reasons rather than the health care needs of vulnerable populations and the stability of the insurance market, Massachusetts Republican Gov. With the feds offering a smaller and smaller share of the total costs to cover a states Medicaid program, the state will have the choice of either finding new revenue via tax hikes or cuts elsewhere in their budgets or making cuts to the program, such as offering fewer benefits or imposing cost-sharing or work requirements (which the Department of Health and Humans Services, under Secretary Tom Price, is already practically begging states to do.) Thats because the metric Republicans propose to increase the amount of funding the feds give states per enrollee over time does not increase as quickly as health care costs rise, nor does it anticipate other unanticipated hikes in per enrollee costs, like the introduction of a new but very expensive drugs.

9080,"Middle-class consumers have counted on the guaranteed income of interest-bearing assets for years, but they've been let down recently by nominal growth rates that are underperforming relative to inflation, leading to real money losses and reduced purchasing power. With the stock market plunge during the Great Recession still fresh in the minds of some middle-class families, some simply can't find a way to generate positive real returns. If businesses continue to seek highly skilled workers, but those jobs are either isolated in certain parts of the country, or middle-class consumers don't have access to a college education to obtain the appropriate skills because of the rising cost of college, it makes landing a well-paying job very difficult. It could be that high debt levels are preventing middle-class Americans from saving, or it could be something as simple as households operating without a working budget. Advertisement One of the biggest challenges for middle-class families is they've watched their wages grow on a nominal basis but stay relatively stagnant on an inflation-adjusted basis. If the middle class doesn't get smarter with its money (i.e., budgeting, saving more, investing in the stock market for the long term), this former backbone of the American economy may continue to wither away. However, when taking into account growing debt, stagnant income, and falling home prices, the actual median wealth of American middle-class households dropped by 28% between 2001 and 2013. Another issue for middle-class families is that they're getting too liberal when it comes to their usage of credit. The Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy has been great news for existing and new homeowners looking to take advantage of great rates, and businesses that've used the access to cheap capital to expand their operations, hire, and even acquire. The middle class can also probably point to the lingering effects of the Great Recession for why they're stuck in neutral.

Please contact your Member of Congress today, and urge them to support the Protect Life Act, H.R. Taking Abortion out of ObamaCare.As you will recall, despite a strenuous outcry by the American People, ObamaCare was enacted without sufficient prohibitions on federal funding for abortion. 358, they will not only be voting for massive taxpayer subsidies of abortion under Obmacare, but they will also be acknowledging what they've denied for so long - that abortion is a huge part of ObamaCare. As we fight to strike down ObamaCare in federal court, where the Supreme Court will ultimately decide its constitutionality, we will also continue fighting to ensure that its provisions that require taxpayer funding for the destruction of human life are repealed. This occurred after the President promised a near-meaningless Executive Order, and after several Members of the House and Senate - most infamously Senator Ben Nelson and Congressman Bart Stupak - were convinced to abandon their call for strong pro-life protections. This funding of abortion through insurance plans, community health centers and other programs created by ObamaCare could have been avoided, but the amendment to ensure these protections was ultimately left out of the final package. However, it's also an important vote for the purpose of giving Americans clarity on this debate of abortion funding. Opponents of this language have long stated that ObamaCare does not fund abortion. This vote is important for a number of reasons, beginning of course with the fact that it's the first step to protect innocent life under ObamaCare. 10.12.2011 Update: President Obama is once again showing that he is the most pro-abortion President our nation has ever seen, now threatening to veto this critical piece of pro-life legislation.

Attempts to get at the truth by House national security committee Chairman Devin Nunes have been countered with demands by Democrats to recuse himself so as to stop his expos of how Team Obama was spying broadly on the incoming administration. Mike Whitney has written an excellent expos of the Russiagate cover story for Obamas political use of national security to help his party oppose Republicans. The real news is the Obama regimes abuse of the governments surveillance powers to spy on Donald Trump and other Republicans in order to build a dossier for the DNC to leak to the press in an attempt to slander or compromise Trump and throw the election to Hillary. Wall Street Journal editorialist Kimberley A. Strassel poses the real question: Why hasnt the Trump administration had the Secret Service arrest Comey, Brennan, Schiff, the DNC and Hillary for trying to overthrow the President of the United States? If Trump fears to prosecute the Obama operatives within the Deep State, they will try all the harder to attack him to the point of forcing his removal or at least discrediting him and his fellow Republicans to pave the way for the 2018 elections. This did not deter Comey from telling Congress that Putin hated Secretary Clinton so much that the flip side of that coin was that he had a clear preference for the person running against the person he hated so much.

A team covenant can make the difference between a cordial work group and a highly functioning team if the process of developing the covenant is authentic and realistic, Simmons said. Use time in the first two team meetings to develop the covenant, based on the norms the team needs to function. While a minister or member of the equipping team may come up with an idea, the new team quickly is passed on to a member of the congregation. Simmons gives six guidelines for developing a covenant that supports the work of a ministry team: Write the covenant as a team. While some committees may function as teams, in order to build and sustain teams, leadership must be intentional and driven by a definitive purpose, he said. Our fun was contagious, and we were often asked to train other teams of volunteers about the need to lighten up' with one another, to encourage long-term service and to prevent burnout. You may serve on more than one ministry team, but we try not to have anyone serving on more than one committee at a time. Ultimately, Simmons believes teams benefit the church because people matter. Committees have a reputation for long, boring meetings where little is accomplished and for structures that rarely take a person's giftedness and passion into account, but rather their availability and inability to say no.' Start with the most obvious areas where teams may already exist, and then work to make them models for the rest of the church.

The U.S. dollar's slide and what lies ahead.NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar took a harsh beating in 2017, on the way to its nearly 10 percent fall, its worst annual performance since 2003. Investors looking for the dollar to see a boost from multinational companies converting foreign profits into dollars may have to temper their hopes for a prolonged rebound. Worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown is just the latest factor that could weigh on sentiment for the dollar in the near term. The rough patch for the U.S. dollar, while not over yet, is forecast to ease in 2018, according to a majority of foreign exchange analysts in a recent Reuters poll. Exceptionally low volatility across the market also diminished the safe-haven allure of the U.S. dollar. To be sure, some analysts warn that the dollars weakness is overdone and excessive bearish bets against the dollar could spur a short squeeze in the event of any positive news for the dollar. Moves by central banks around the world toward monetary policy normalization, increased political uncertainty in the United States and the dearth of volatility across markets have hurt the greenback. If global investors look to diversify their dollar holdings into other currencies such as the euro, that could weigh on the dollar. The slower-than-expected delivery by the Trump administration on some of its economic promises hurt the dollar, reversing its initial post-election rally. Market participants were betting that the U.S. economy would outperform its European, Japanese and Chinese counterparts and that U.S. monetary policy would tighten much more aggressively than it would elsewhere in the global economy.

As reported by The New York Daily News, parents and students at a talent show for Manhattan public schools on May 25 watched a ""surprise"" performance from Public School 96 Parent Teacher Association President Frankie Quinones, in which the PTA president, dressed in full-blown drag queen attire, grinded the floor of the stage, spread his legs open to the crowd and rolled around in a sexually suggestive manner while lip-synching a 1980's song. People were horrified, said one parent of a fifth-grader who attended the show, Raquel Morales. That's when Quinones hit the stage for the raunchy drag performance: At that moment, Quinones, who parents said performs in drag clubs around the city, took the stage in a sparkly black dress and pumps and began to shake his hips as a slinky Iris Chacn mambo blared from the public address system.

Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama, he tweeted. Trump on Monday endorsed Moore over Democratic candidate Doug Jones in the closely-contested race for Alabamas vacant Senate seat. One woman alleged that Moore initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979 when she was 14 and he was 32. Another woman claimed that Moore, a former justice on Alabamas Supreme Court, sexually assaulted her when she was 16. I am throwing in with the Democratic Party because at the end of the day, I believe its portrait of America is better than the one being painted by todays Republican Party. Trump added, referencing House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). Multiple women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct after the first claims against him emerged last month. Moore has steadfastly denied the allegations, labeling them as politically motivated attacks from Democrats and an unfriendly media.

8885,"What defined Middle American Radicals was an ideology that was neither conventionally liberal nor conventionally conservative, but instead revolved around an intense conviction that the middle class was under siege from above and below, writes Judis, summarizing Warrens research. And this is exactly as Lipset would predict: Both evidence and theory suggest that the lower strata are relatively more authoritarian, that they will be more attracted toward an extremist movement than toward a moderate and democratic one, and that, once recruited, they will not be alienated by its lack of democracy, while more educated or sophisticated supporters will tend to drop away. Who Are Trump’s Supporters?.In one of the final issues of National Journal, John Judis wrote a characteristically thoughtful and historically minded explanation of the stunning support among Republicans for Donald Trump. But rather than seeing most Trumpists as Middle American Radicals or even a uniquely American phenomenon, it is more accurate to see them as the latest in a long line of working-class authoritarianspeople with a very scary, very dishonorable past. Which is why William Galston of the Brookings Institution analyzed the data and wrote that Trump is the staunchest champion of the white working class that American politics has seen in decades. But in addition to their views, according to Judis, Middle American Radicals were of similar economic class; as their name and perspective suggests, they were middle-class. Now, not all of Trumps supporters are working-class whites, and not all working-class whites are Trump supporters (mercifully). Trumps boosters are examples of a phenomenon that the late Seymour Martin Lipset termed working class authoritarianism. Trumpists, Judis wrote, are comprised mostly of a demographic of Middle American Radicals, a term invented by sociologist Donald Warren in the 1970s. The piece contained interviews with Trumpists who buttressed the notion that they are Middle American Radicals. A white lower-educated supporter on the lower-income scale is not what we normally term middle-class: Its more aptly called the working-",1,1

The U.S. Yemen partnership has fed sectarian tensions in Yemen as Hadi used U.S. aid to fight the Houthis to the north of the capital near the Saudi border, which may have served to fuel the groups anti-American stance and its attack on the capital. The turmoil in Yemen has raised questions about President Obamas intention to use the relationship with Yemen as a model for fighting IS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria), rather than deploying U.S. troops to the area. The U.S. has used Yemen as a base of operations to fight AQAP in the Arab Peninsula, the group taking credit for the attacks at the Paris offices of satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, on Jan. 7. On the same day,#160;the U.S. State Department announced that the embassy in the Yemen capital city of Sanaa was closed to the public citing the resignations and ongoing security concerns.

One underreported reason for this is that Obama opted to create a parallel institution out of his 2012 campaign outfit, Organizing for America. It seems axiomatic that any party weak enough to be taken over by Hillary Clinton is not in good health. ADVERTISEMENT Donna Brazile, the longtime high-ranking Democratic functionary, was made interim chair of the party shortly before the 2016 election in the wake of revelations that the previous chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, seemed to be playing favorites in the primaries, tilting the scales toward Hillary Clinton and against Bernie Sanders. Wasserman Schultz cut a deal with the Clinton campaign in which Clinton would raise millions ostensibly for the party, particularly at the state level.

If the Fed and Treasury succeed in controlling the situation and avoiding a collapse of the global financial system, then it is a near certainty that Big Finance albeit a financial sector that will look very different than it appeared a year ago will rally itself to oppose new regulatory standards. The Financial Re-Regulatory Agenda.As the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department careen from one financial meltdown to another, desperately trying to hold together the financial system and with it, the U.S. and global economy there are few voices denying that Wall Street has suffered from excesses over the past several years. But they also enable extremely risky investments since they can vastly exceed an investors actual assets that can threaten not just the investor but, if replicated sufficiently, the entire financial system. Meanwhile, further financial conglomeration worsens the too big to fail problem with the possible failure of the largest institutions viewed as too dangerous to the financial system to be tolerated that Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson cannot now avoid despite his best efforts. The hyper-complexity of the existing financial system makes it hard to get a handle on how to reform the financial sector. Credit unions can deliver the basic banking services that people need, but they need back-up institutional support to spread and flourish. This means that, once you take the tax effect into account, any given company can support much more debt than it can equity. Especially with the government safety net including access to Federal Reserve funds extended beyond the traditional banking sector, this regulatory black hole must be eliminated. When the investment banks return to high-risk activity at scale (and over time they will, unless prohibited by regulators), they will directly endanger the banks of which they are a part.

1746,"Poll: Why Suburban Voters Will Be Pivotal in Presidential Race.The competitiveness of the 2016 race is directly tied to one critical group of voters that both the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns covet - those who live in the suburbs. Clinton has consistently led the Republican nominee among city-dwellers; these results are expected as these voters are typically more racially and economically diverse and historically tend to vote Democratic in national elections. Urban voters, on the other hand, have supported Clinton over Trump by at least 20 points over the past eight weeks. Among suburban voters in the most recent tracking poll, Trump led by 2 points 47 percent to 45 percent. In the latest tracking poll results, Trump had a 24-point advantage over Clinton among these voters, 58 to 34 percent. Just before the Democratic convention, Trump led Clinton among suburban voters by 7 points. While urban and rural support for Clinton and Trump has remained steady for months, suburban voter support is fluctuating between Clinton and Trump week-to-week. In the latest tracking poll results, 62 percent of urban voters said they support Clinton and only 31 percent said they support Trump. The race is close in suburban American, and the campaigns are subsequently conducting their most intensive get-out-the-vote efforts in those areas. By mapping eight weeks of data from the NBC News SurveyMonkey Weekly Tracking Poll by zip code into rural, urban and suburban categories, it is clear that slight shifts in the presidential race are occurring mostly in suburban areas across the United States. Just as Clinton leads Trump in urban areas, Trump comfortably leads Clinton among rural voters.

Heres the rub, though.#160;Who did Jesus tell to take care of the poor, the hungry, to clothe the naked, to visit prisoners etc.? Yet despite his over 140 character limit, Jesus never said Blessed are those who believe the government should tax people, so that government can redistribute it and give to others. I get it, sometimes Jesus used parables to make things easier to understand. Across the board, regardless of income level or faith, Conservatives give much more personal contributions to charity than liberals do Arthur Brooks, the author of a book on donors to charity, Who Really Cares, cites data that households headed by conservatives give 30 percent more to charity than households headed by liberals. Okay, yeah, that does sound obvious, doesnt it, what with me pointing it out all of one paragraph up? See, in order for the government to give money to people who do not have it, or have not earned it, the money must first be taken#160;from people. In the days before Twitter, Jesus had to simplify a lot of things so people would remember his teachings and subsequently pass them#160;down via oral transmission.

4505,"United Technologies' shares rise as it weighs spinning off Sikorsky; analysts approve move.Shares in United Technologies rose Thursday after the company said it is considering spinning off its Sikorsky helicopter division. Continue Reading Below United Technologies said Wednesday it will consider a tax-free spinoff of Sikorsky, among other options. He said he thinks United Technologies will spin off Sikorsky instead of selling it because of the tax benefits that would accompany a spinoff. He added that a separation would reduce the risk United Technologies faces from a potential slump in defense-related sales. Industry analysts backed the move, saying it would allow the conglomerate to develop its remaining businesses, while reducing its exposure to cuts in defense spending. Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment noted Sikorsky brings in about 10 percent of the company's revenue but only 6 percent of its profits.

9490,"While insisting that Ankara can maneuver independently of Moscow, Kiniklioglu admitted that Turkey has to get along well with a country that provides you with over 60 percent of natural gas. Considering that Turkmenistans economy is primarily dependent on Russia, it is unlikely that Ashgabat will sell its gas to any country but Russia, at least not without Moscow's permission. Northern Iraq is thought to have large gas reserves, but it will take years to develop them, and, said Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based Center for Economic and Foreign Policy Studies, Political instability during the past decade made it impossible to estimate how much capacity there is and how it can be channeled to Nabucco. Turkey depends on Russia for 65 percent of its domestic gas use and is also desperate to diversify its sources: There are gas cuts every winter, said Necdet Pamir, a former high-level official with Turkeys state-owned oil company and a board member of the World Energy Council. The same with Iran, said Kiniklioglu, the Turkish Foreign Affairs Committee spokesman, pointing to the fact that Turkey already imports Iranian gas for its domestic market. Talks are also underway for the South Stream pipeline, a direct competitor to Nabucco that would transport Russian gas via the Black Sea to Bulgaria, Austria and Italy. As a result, countries including Austria, Bulgaria and Hungary have no choice but to import most of their gas from Russia. The Azerbaijan-Russia MOU#160;comes at a difficult time for Bakus ties to Ankara: Our recent move to normalize relations with Armenia has complicated Azerbaijani attitudes toward Turkey and thereby Nabucco, said Suat Kiniklioglu, spokesman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Turkish Parliament. While it has the worlds second largest reserves of natural gas after Russia, Iran is, according to Stanislav Tkachenko of St. Petersburg State University, a politically impossible alternative, because it would require radically improved relationship between Iran and the United States. To strengthen its near monopoly, Moscow buys almost all the gas produced by Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

In his attempt to reconcile his attachment to the EU and desire to see it swap austerity for a policy that is more favourable to jobs and the environment (and less unforgiving towards states such as Greece, which are crippled with debt), Hamon has had to convince himself that the change of direction he hopes for is possible, even in the context of existing institutions; that achieving tangible results without turning our backs on Europe is conceivable. Apart from the very real danger of it being used one day by a head of state less benign than Hollande, the grandiose declarations about French democracy and the republic run counter to a fact that Hollande has made blindingly clear: the solitary exercise of power makes it possible to trample on campaign pledges, which should be the basis of a popular mandate. As he does not have great faith in a concerted push by the left in the near future, since it has been on the wane in recent years, he believes that France, as the EUs second most powerful nation, is becoming the driving force of the European battle.

Whats worrisome about this is that the global economic recovery has assumed widespread deleveraging the repayment of debt by businesses and households. Like homeowners, companies can afford larger loans at low rates, the report says, and since debt markets are flush with cash, few [borrowers] get turned down. Government debt has played a bigger role since the crisis, but private debts borrowings by firms and people represent two-thirds of all debt. Whats called the debt overhang is already acting as a drag on the world economy, says Hung Tran of the Institute of International Finance, an industry research group. But once debts had receded to manageable levels, consumer and business spending would bounce back. Private debt is high not only among advanced economies, but also in many emerging-market countries (China, Brazil). The more that is borrowed, the more likely that borrowers, lenders or both will pull back, further undermining economic growth. Compared to the early 1980s, when interest rates were very high, there may be more space for higher debt levels, says Cline. Perhaps societies can operate with debt levels that once were considered imprudent. Also, there isnt any magic threshold beyond which a countrys debts automatically become unsustainable.

Artists cant solve social ills But#160;I have become aware of an ethos held by many in Chicagos arts education community that may, in the long term, be counterproductive to our advocacy.#160; This is the widely embraced view of social rectification through the arts: A belief that the arts can fix whats wrong with kids or that the arts will better our society in general if arts programs are promoted as agents for social justice.#160; A laudatory example of this effort is the Now is the Time initiative undertaken by numerous Chicago theatre companies to combat youth and gang violence. To effectively traverse the changing education landscape, we must reevaluate how we deliver arts education by taking a hard look at what we do and why we do it.#160; All too often, I witness confirmation bias in our field and incidences in which colleagues take up residence in an echo chamber of group-think without questioning the basis on which we make our assumptions.#160; We will accomplish little if we only align our energies with social remediation without significantly deepening students academic capacities.

3717,"The ferocious resistance encountered last week by the 1,000-strong US marine task force trying to fight its way into villages around the towns of Qaim and Obeidi in western Iraq shows that the war is far from over. After the crescendo of violence over the past month there should be no doubts that the US has not quashed the insurgents whom for two years American military spokesmen have portrayed as a hunted remnant of Saddam Husseins regime assisted by foreign fighters. But the outside world remained largely unaware, because no reporters were present with US forces, that at the same moment an insurgent offensive had captured most of Mosul, a city five times larger than Fallujah. It means reporters are only present where American troops are active, though US forces seldom venture into much of Iraq. So far nine marines have been killed in the week-long campaign, while another US soldier was killed and four wounded in central Iraq on Friday. We discovered the US troops had suddenly abandoned the main road between Kirkuk and Baghdad without telling anybody, said one indignant observer. At first the US did not realise that all Iraqi men have guns and they considered possession of a weapon a sign of hostile intention towards the occupation. Ironically, the extent of US failure to control Iraq is masked by the fact that it is too dangerous for the foreign media to venture out of central Baghdad. There is a sense of bitterness among many US National Guardsmen that they have been shanghaied into fighting in a dangerous war. During the heavily publicised assault on Fallujah the US forces drained the rest of Iraq of its soldiers. Why has the vastly expensive and heavily equipped US army failed militarily in Iraq? For the election on 30 January, US reserves arriving in Iraq were all sent to Mosul to raise the level to 15,000 to prevent any uprising in the city.",1,1

When widely syndicated columnist Cal Thomas posted a commentary on his website (1/15/09) opposing federal bailouts, he cited quotes from Thomas Jefferson to bolster his argument, including: The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not. In reality, several founders (including Madison) were not Christians, and Limbaughs Madison quote is a fraud, as revealed in FAIRs 1995 book, The Way Things Arent: Rush Limbaughs Reign of Error. As Rush Limbaugh (or ghostwriter Joseph Farah) wrote of the founders in his 1994 book See, I Told You So, Dont believe the conventional wisdom of our day that says these men were anything but orthodox, Bible-believing Christians.

CORRECTION: The original version of this article cited two quotations attributed by Cal Thomas to Jefferson as dubious: It is incumbent on every generation to pay off its own debts as it goes. Appropriately, upon learning later in the show that the thesis might be a hoax, Limbaugh responded, I dont care if these quotes are made up.

10255,"SoCal support for bullet train wavers.Californias beleaguered high-speed rail project has hit yet another speed bump: a loss of confidence among Southern California officials already left hanging by plans that shifted first-stage construction northward. California#160;lawmakers expressed dissatisfaction Monday with a plan to change the direction of a $64 billion high-speed railway, the Associated Press noted. The catch,#160;SCAG#160;discovered, is that costs imposed by completing#160;the initial segment will#160;ensure that#160;all the existing funds would be exhausted, leaving uncertainty about how and when the line would ever cross the geologically complex mountains of Southern California, as the paper added. Proponents of a proposed initiative to divert high-speed rail funding to water projects said Friday that they are pulling their petitions from the street and instead will pursue a place on the 2018 ballot, the Sacramento Bee reported. Rather than pay the spiraling rate, proponents are pulling back and targeting 2018, a non-presidential year where fewer Democratic voters, and presumably less supporters of high-speed rail, turn out to the polls. Until the high-speed rail authority released a new draft business plan last month, the state had planned to open its first operating segment between Burbank and the Central Valley by 2022. California voters have largely remained devoted to at least the idea of high-speed rail. A third of adults and a quarter of likely voters said rail is very important to the future quality of life and economic vitality of California. Californias high-speed railway is attempting to do what the Tokaido Shinkansen does, but with a third of the number of potential passengers, on a route that is half as long again, the Economist argued, warning that Californias taxpayers will pay dearly for Mr. Browns high-speed legacy. Nevertheless, even universal support for the bullet train would not keep it afloat operationally, analysts noted, without extraordinary usage rates.

9443,"Struggling British retailer Marks amp; Spencer is expected to announce plans next week to shut some stores at home and abroad, with analysts forecasting a slump in first-half profit and another fall in clothing sales. However his plan, outlined in May, came with a warning of a short-term dent to sales and profit, and in July the group reported its worst quarterly clothing sales for a decade. The division comprises 468 stores across 58 international markets, including 194 owned by Mamp;S. Advertisement Seeking to cut costs, some of these stores in Western European markets, including France, as well as in China are expected to be ditched by Rowe, according to analysts, as he seeks to return the division to profitable growth by reversing the expansion of his predecessor. For the second quarter to Oct. 1, Mamp;S is expected to report a 3.9 percent fall in sales of clothing and homeware at shops open over a year, according to a company compiled consensus of eight analysts' forecasts. Profit at Mamp;S's overseas business, which contributes about 7 percent to the group total, slumped 40 percent in the 2015-16 fiscal year, mainly due to losses at its own - rather than franchised - stores. Shares in Mamp;S have fallen 23 percent this year, hammered by the May profit warning and fears a drop in sterling after Britain's vote to leave the European Union will increase sourcing costs. But given the growth of e-commerce, they do expect Rowe to signal a small number of store closures and a desire for a smaller estate over time, as well as plans to correct some badly performing shops through re-locations and new layouts. That would be an improvement on the first quarter slump of 8.9 percent. Analysts are on average forecasting flat second-quarter like-for-like sales.

Robert Levinsons family told The Associated Press this week that Trumps background as a deal-making businessman and his harder line on Iran could be an asset in finally determining what happened to the investigator, whose 69th birthday is Friday. White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Monday that the Trump administration was in contact with Levinsons family and said we continue to hold out hope that he could be safely returned from Iran. Rumors have circulated for years, with one account claiming he was locked up in a Tehran prison run by Irans paramilitary Revolution Guard and U.S. officials suggesting he may not be in Iran at all. That lack of response, even with the U.N.s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issuing a report in January that held Iran responsible for addressing the situation of Mr. Levinson without any further delay, has the family believing Trumps harder line on Iran might finally force the country to release him. For years, U.S. officials would only say that Levinson, a meticulous FBI investigator credited with busting Russian and Italian mobsters, was working for a private firm on his trip. Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive living in Iran who is wanted for the assassination of a former Iranian diplomat in Maryland in 1980, is the last known person to have seen Levinson before his disappearance.

For instance, it makes most sense to pay off your loan with the highest interest rate first, but unless you ask specifically, [student servicing companies] typically spread the payment out across all the loans, and that policy is not best for student loan borrowers. Continue Reading Below On Monday, as part of his push to assist students buried in debt, President Obama said the Department of Education would be renegotiating contracts to make sure students best interest came first. Part of President Obamas new effort also allows the Education Department to reduce interest rates automatically for eligible servicemembers without the need for additional paper work. The announcement comes on the heels of student loan contractor Navient Corp., which took over Sallie Maes student loan servicing business, agreeing to pay almost $100 million to settle claims it overcharged military members who took out education loans. As a result of our proactive outreach, student loan borrowers whose federal loans are serviced by Navient are 30% less likely to default than others. Often times, borrowers are making payments to these service companies, but they are not always advantageous to the student, she says.

Express Scripts won't give up $3 billion like Anthem wants, but the PBM probably will offer to make some significant financial concessions.

Now that Ethiopia has become a source of peacekeepers in Sudan some of these Ethiopian tanks may be used to uphold Pax Americana on the North-South Sudanese border which includes Sudans oil fields. Tanks work well against lightly armed guerilla fighters and even better when it comes to crushing civilian uprisings, something those in the western and UN aid agencies are fully cognizant of.

Ministers there have considered chipping criminals with RFID devices an idea that is entirely possible, as biohackers like Graafstra know all too well. In fact, if they are so inclined, Indonesian officials could always opt to track rapists using a device already worn by some 200,000 Americans whove run afoul of the law: the clunky, plastic ankle monitor. And for good reason: it would likely require burying a much larger device containing a battery and antenna inside a persons body. As one official proclaimed, the implants would allow authorities to track their every footstep. Graafstra is a self-described double RFID implantee: two radio-frequency identification chips, one in each hand, allow him to log on to his computer and even start his motorcycle with a wave of the palms. The RFID transmission radius, Graafstra says, is limited to feet or a mere one to two centimeters to get a good read. In other words: To know the exact whereabouts of implanted animals, you still have to download data from the physical chips. Its a completely pointless endeavor which damages the real-world use cases for human-implanted RFID transponders. Though Indonesian officials current proposal to microchip criminals appears unfeasible, similar concepts have swirled around parliaments as far away as the United Kingdom. In the US, RFID devices are used to track inmates within prisons but take the form of anklets, not implants.

On both analytical and empirical grounds, there is not a significant basis for anticipating that Muslim Americans are increasingly motivated or capable of successfully engaging in lethal terrorist attacks in the United States. The first concerns what is known about the radicalization of Muslim Americans and whether a surge in arrests in 2009 indicates a growing trend in Muslim American terrorism. The analysis should be generally reassuring to those concerned about Muslim homegrown terrorism. Three conditions, either alone or together, could contribute to an increasing threat of homegrown terrorism. The third depends on the skills of aspiring terrorists and therefore their capacities to execute increasingly sophisticated attacks. The second relates to the capacity of aspiring militants to avoid detection as they prepare attacks.",0,0

A Democratic Party of New Mexico employee and her boyfriend embezzled about $2,000 from the party by forging and cashing four checks using the signature of Javier Gonzales, the chairman of the Democratic Party, according to a warrant issued in Metropolitan Court on Saturday. The employee, Cassandra Romero, age 21, was arrested on Feb. 5 when the embezzlement was first discovered at the Democratic Partys office, according to court documents. The warrant was issued for the arrest of 20-year-old Larry Daniel Maez, the employees boyfriend. Romero told police that Maez persuaded her to write the checks by telling her that he was going to show pictures of her doing drugs to her parents unless she gave him money, according to the arrest warrant. An accountant conducting an audit of the accounts noticed four checks had been cashed three made out to Maez and one made out to Romero but were not properly signed, according to an arrest warrant. Romero had been an intern with the Democratic Party since August and had been working in a part-time role since October. He was booked into jail on Saturday when he and another man were caught stealing the tires off a black Camaro, according to a criminal complaint.

FARMINGTON Adding a period to the school day the principals of Farmington and Piedra Vista high schools say would provide students who have fallen behind because of a failed class or a dropped credit a chance to catch up. Gattis said the seven-period day would open up more opportunities for students to take courses they failed and more opportunities to take more electives courses. Kienitz said ninth-grade math and English would be a focus should the class schedule change, and if students are struggling with those subjects or other core classes, they could attend an intervention course to boost their skills. I feel like we need to build in time for credit recovery, support for students struggling with classes and interventions, he said. The additional period also would give students more flexibility in scheduling elective courses, they said. ADVERTISEMENT So the students take six periods a year for four years, it doesnt give them any room, Gattis said. Core subjects like math, English, social studies and science will see a slight decrease in class size as the same number of students are spread out through the day. If they like music and want to take more than one music class, if they want two periods of band, it gives them opportunities. The proposed school day will have seven class periods approximately 52 or 51 minutes long and end 15 minutes later at 3:15 p.m. Farmington Principal Tim Kienitz said the discussion about adding a period started even before the school district enacted closed-campus policies for the high schools two years ago. At that time, counselors will start visiting eighth-grade classes across the district and signing them up. A seven-period day will also correct an issue some students face in their fourth-period classes, as their lunch period splits up their time in class. Kienitz said that in the A to F school grading system established by the state last year, Farmington High received its lowest marks in college readiness and has seen the attendance numbers dropping in the career-tech education courses.",0,0

""We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant U.K. law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action,"" a Treasury spokeswoman said. Peter Hain, a former cabinet minister and member of the House of Lords, confirmed on Thursday that he had written to Mr. Hammond last month about allegations by a whistleblower that HSBC and Standard Chartered may have inadvertently served as conduits for corrupt proceeds. The scandal so far has ensnared international firms including KPMG International, SAP SE and McKinsey amp; Co., and led to the collapse of the U.K. arm of public relations firm Bell Pottinger over its work for a Gupta holding company. KPMG, which audited Gupta companies for 15 years, last month removed the leadership of its South African branch after an internal probe found it fell short of its own standards during the 15 years it audited Gupta companies. According to documents that appear to have been come from a Gupta company hard drive, and which have been reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, several Standard Chartered accounts were used in 2013 to transfer money between Gupta-controlled companies in South Africa and Dubai to pay for a lavish family wedding. South African police and prosecutors have said they are investigating allegations of corruption, including potential kickbacks from international companies, which were brought to light by a flood of emails and other documents that appear to have been obtained from Gupta-controlled companies. Both banks have so-called deferred prosecution agreements with the U.S. over failings in their anti-money laundering controls, among other breaches.

These types of skiers (for better or worse, I consider myself one of them) dont wait for their friends when the conditions are deep and light, because skiing powder is as close as you can get to flying.

Things are even worse online, so bad in fact that a famous actress, in this case Jessica Chastain, can now use her Twitter account to falsely accuse a dead man of rape. Even Schneider herself said it was not rape: That scene wasnt in the original script. Instead, Bertolucci confessed in the 2013 clip that he and Marlon Brando came up with the idea to shoot the assault scene in which Brando's character uses a stick of butter to rape Schneider on screen. An actor is never more vulnerable than during a sex scene and to manipulate Schneider (who died in 2011) in this way is disrespectful of her talent and highly unprofessional. It's known as one of the most infamous rape scenes in Hollywood historybut Last Tango in Paris director Bernardo Bertolucci admitted in a recently surfaced video that star Maria Schneider never consented to it. Now I am in no way saying that what Bertolucci did was appropriate (for the record, Brando also felt exploited and humiliated by the director).

Given the current shortage of priests in many dioceses, some bishops are reluctant to release priests for work in the AMS as military chaplains; thus Catholic billets in the chaplain corps are chronically under-filled, and Catholics on overseas deployments can go weeks, sometimes months, without having access to the sacraments. I rather doubt that most of us would rank Brooklyn (the countrys only completely urban diocese) as high on the league table as it in fact is, and Im willing to wager that not one in twenty Catholics would put Rockville Centre and Orange (California) in the top ten. Its priests are drawn from all over the United States; but they must have the permission of the local bishop to serve, and they remain canonically a part of their home diocese. One might think that a national collection in support of such vital work which is done on behalf of all U.S. Catholics would be a good idea, but there are objections to increasing the number of national collections. Thus AMS must rely on donations from individuals, parish, diocesan, and military communities, bequests from wills, and grants from philanthropies.

China accuses US of launching global ""internet war"" (VIDEO).The Chinese military has accused the U.S. of launching a global "" Internet war"" to bring down Arab and other governments, days after Google traced hacks on the Gmail accounts of U.S. officials to China. Google traced the origin of the hackings to the city of Jinan, home to a military vocational school whose computers were linked to a more sophisticated assault on Google's systems 17 months ago.

12852,"It's true those brands do still retain a store of value, even if they've been diminished over the years because of Lampert's penchant for ignoring the nuts and bolts of his retail operation in favor of financial gimmicks, but this latest attempt to cash in on the consumer goodwill that still attaches to them looks like the result of having thrown a bunch of ideas at a whiteboard and choosing those that stuck. We knew Chairman Eddie Lampert was considering how best to extract value from the retailer's remaining brands -- Kenmore, Craftsman, and DieHard -- but most of the ideas seemed to center around spinning them off, selling them, or at the very least putting them in stores other than Sears or Kmart. By itself that's not a bad idea; many companies use brand extensions to incrementally increase revenues, but such moves really do need to be aligned with how consumers view the brand. There are definitely things Sears can do in this vein that will further enhance the reputation and sales of the various brands, and this may be a better option than spinning them off as Lampert has previously done. It also means Sears is entering a space that is thick with competition, and Kenmore isn't bringing anything new or different other than its name. Although the leap to the living room doesn't seem much of a stretch, it does require consumers to think about the brand in a whole new way. Because car batteries have an obvious affiliation with automobiles, DieHard tires seem like a good extension, and a survey of consumers about the brands they liked best found DieHard tires ranked third (even though they don't exist). But people have been buying Craftsman-branded garage door openers for years, so this is akin to adding a few bells and whistles to an existing product, much like the tool storage unit that you can lock and unlock with your smartphone. The Craftsman wifi enabled garage door opener seems more of an incremental change rather than a radical new product, and is part of Lampert's larger effort to emphasize the connected home.

2337,"In the period 1997-2002, farm suicides in the Big 5 States accounted for roughly one out of every 12 of all suicides in the country. For instance, Maharashtra saw a decline in farm suicide numbers in 2005, but the very next year proved to be its worst ever. The State added US$108.5 million for a one-time settlement (OTS) for poor farmers who had been excluded from the waiver altogether because they owned over five acres of land. The State-wise farm suicide ratios number of farmers committing suicide per 100,000 farmers are still pegged on the outdated 2001 figures. Yet, that proved to be the worst three-year period ever for any State at any time since the recording of farm data began. The 12-year period allows us to compare farm suicide numbers for 1997-2002, with how they turned out in the next 6-year period of 2003-2008. Yet it could also be argued that but for the relief the waiver brought to some farmers at least, the suicide numbers of 2008 could have been a lot worse. For one thing, the total number of suicides (all groups, not just farmers) is increasing in a growing population. Manmohan Singhs visit to Vidharbha that year brought the Prime Ministers Relief Package of US$814,330 million for six crisis-ridden districts of the region. The dismal truth is that very high numbers of farm suicides still occur within a fast decreasing farm population. The government was trying to beat the crisis leaving in place all its causes with a one-off waiver. So the 2011 Census, with more authentic counts of how many farmers there really are, might provide an unhappy update on what is going on.",1,1

For this reason, it may be time for opponents to begin focusing more on the negative social costs starting with the massive disruption now unfolding in the Central Valley and the shaky prospects for promised economic development than on the high costs per rider and the negative operating and financial costs. High-speed rail wont reduce much air pollution in the Central Valley anyway because the bulk of the long-distance commuters are not business or tourist travelers. It might be painful, but high-speed rail opponents need to#160; bite the bullet#160;and realize that focusing on accounting details like estimated losses per rider is not likely to result in a red light for the project. have found that high-speed rail has the highest and most undesirable social costs and air travel the least.#160; Moreover, permanent economic development induced by high-speed rail is too speculative and unquantifiable to be included in most cost-benefit studies. High-speed rail critics may think they are doing a good job making the case against the project. For example, the Brown administrations claim that it could readily trim $30 billion from the projects previous tab of $98 billion and still have a true statewide high-speed rail system is ripe for attack. Proponents have been able to keep enough of the public and enough special interests on their side by emphasizing near-term construction jobs, green power development, and speculative long-term real estate and tourist development.

469,"A separate measure by the real estate data firm Zillow shows that prices in Seattle's University District have shot up nearly 17 percent in the past 12 months, a sign that walkable neighborhoods may soon price out its least prosperous residents. The Redfin analysis shows that few walkable communities also have access to better-than-average public and charter schools - meaning that their home values might rise and cause affordability to drop. Though housing in the University District is expensive - the median home value is near $620,000, roughly triple the national level - high area incomes tend to make it relatively affordable. Some cities, such as Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia, contained balanced neighborhoods - where people of different income classes could afford to live - but their schools performed poorly. And many of those neighborhoods exist in only two cities: Washington and Seattle, according to a new analysis released Wednesday by the real estate brokerage Redfin. Compared with older generations, millennials, ages 18 to 34, disproportionately prefer walking, according to a survey released in July by the National Association of Realtors and the Transportation Research and Education Center at Portland State University. Across the country, just 14 percent of neighborhoods manage to be at once affordably priced, walkable and near decent schools. The analysis examined 170 neighborhoods in 20 cities, comparing home sales and income data with rankings from the organizations Walk Score and GreatSchools. The findings suggest a substantial mismatch between the neighborhoods where people say they want to live and the homes actually available to them. In the Redfin report, only 24 neighborhoods in eight cities met all three criteria of walkability, affordability and schools.

Many immigrants in the US who lost hope that America will ever allow them to stay have flocked to a Roxham Road dead-end in the state of New York, which has become an unofficial gateway to Canada for the migrants. In July, US Border patrol agents caught 18,198 individuals trying to illegally cross from Mexico.

On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice said#160;that 49,983 of illegal immigrants have been ordered deported since February. Meanwhile, the flow of illegal immigrants into the US through Mexico has also spiked this summer. The administrations ban on refugees has also scared many who were hoping to get asylum in the US. The number of people trying to get into the United States through its southern border has risen for the third consecutive month, according to the Department of Homeland Security, surging 15 percent in July compared to the month before.

The government has also used those lists to criminalize purely humanitarian efforts to strengthen Palestinian society most notoriously in the case of the Holy Land Five.

Obama told Pavlopoulos at a morning meeting that a strong NATO is of utmost importance and would provide significant continuity even as we see a transition in government in the United States. Pavlopoulos, for his part, thanked Obama for U.S. support of the Greek people in a time of social and economic crisis, and said he was confident that Trump will continue on the same path. Yet they may be greeted with skepticism: For months throughout the campaign, Obama repeatedly assured world leaders in public and private that Trump would not be elected, only to see him emerge victorious from last weeks election. The more aggressively and effectively we deal with those issues, the less those fears may channel themselves into counterproductive approaches that can pit people against each other, Obama said as he opened the last foreign tour of his presidency. Tsipras, for his part, said he had refrained from rushing to criticizing Trump as some other European leaders had done, saying that the Republicans aggressive manner as a candidate might be different as president. Obama pledged to keep pressing his view that austerity alone cannot deliver prosperity and that it is going to be important both with respect to debt relief and other accommodative strategies to help the Greek people in this period of adjustment. In brief remarks, Obama quoted Pericles and offered a toast: To the virtues and values that unite us across a broad sea, may the Greeks and Americans always be there for each other, as partners, as compatriots, brothers, sisters stin ygeia sas, cheers. Trumps election has generated significant unease in Europe because of his tough talk during the campaign suggesting the U.S. might pull out of the NATO alliance if other countries dont pay more.

One question about Kurdish Iraqi secession is the exact borders of Kurdistan. The Kurds say that no Iraqi government troops from Baghdad can ever set foot on Kurdistan soil. In summer of 2014 after the Sunni Arab provinces acceded to the ISIL (Daesh) caliphate, the Peshmerga militarily occupied Kirkuk, and seem reluctant to relinquish that province. Iraqi Court Strikes Down Kurdistan Referendum.The Iraqi Supreme Court#160; has ordered that a Kurdish referendum on independence planned for September 25 be halted. The problem is that the Iraqi Supreme Courts decision will not be recognized or honored by the elites in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), the Kurdish super-province. Kurds were mistreated by the Arab nationalist regimes of Iraq (Kurds are not Arabs) and were gassed by Saddam Hussein, and almost all of them want their own country now. KRG president Massoud Barzani has said that he will power through the referendum despite vehement protests from Baghdad, Iran, Turkey and even the Trump administration. (Maybe Kirkuk used to be largely Turkmen, but that by now hasnt been true for a while; Kurds are now the majority).

It was in his December 4th, 2007 press conference, after release of the National Intelligence Estimate on Irans nuclear weapons programs, that Bush signaled he was prepared to make the leap: On the one hand, we should exert pressure, and on the other hand, we should provide the Iranians a way forward.

Not all moose are looking for a fight right now, but they do tend to get a little cranky this time of year, Marsh said. Feeding moose can trigger attacks, and the woman who was kicked in the head unintentionally was doing just that, Herreman said. It pulled its nose out of the bucket, looked at her, reared back and kicked her right in the noggin, said Jason Herreman, assistant area biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. One of the animals walked up behind a woman tending chickens in the city of Homer on Sunday and started eating chicken food from a bucket she carried. She had been allowing her chickens to roam and would periodically throw them feed, not knowing that a moose born last year had been chasing the chickens off to eat the feed, he said.

Everyone wanted people to come and see that a large portion of the food was consumable, and the items that werent up to radiation standards were being thrown out right away. The Japanese government quickly installed measures to test all of the new crops in the region, and fully subsidized the endeavour to keep food production costs on par with the unaffected areas of the country.

Those ingredients, along with a marketing effort that appealed to young moviegoers, pushed ""Homecoming"" to the best ""Spider-Man"" debut since 2007's ""Spider-Man 3."" ""It's a triumphant return for Spider-Man,"" said Josh Greenstein, Sony Pictures' president of worldwide marketing and distribution. ""Spider-Man"" is one of three major summer hits thus far, following the Marvel-Disney sequel ""Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. Edgar Wright's acclaimed action-musical ""Baby Driver"" slid just 38 percent in its second week, coming in third with $12.8 million. ""Even though there have been other Spider-Man movies, this film feels fresh and new and different and special, and I think that's what's really resonating with audiences right now,"" added Greenstein.

I dont think any man or woman should run for president, Biden said then, unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, two, they can look at folks out there and say, I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy and my passion to do this. What Biden told Stephen Colbert last month is what he was telling his friends, and it rang entirely true about a man for whom family is not a word trotted out for political consumption but a commitment that goes to the core of who he is and what makes him such an attractive human being. And many, inside the party and out, longed for someone who can campaign with credibility on the theme Biden sounded: It all starts with giving the middle class a fighting chance. But Biden has always had Republican friends, and he knows thats the way politics should be. The longing for Biden, so palpable among some of the party pros the day before Clintons strong performance, dissipated immediately afterward. And the man who noted hes often called Middle-Class Joe felt he had never been a better match for the historical moment. Shots at Biden in recent days about, for example, what exactly he said and thought about Obamas decision to try to kill Osama bin Laden were also a sign of coming distractions and unpleasantness. Perhaps these, too, gave Biden second thoughts, although someone who has taken as many hard hits as he has over the years certainly knew already what awaited him if he ran. Biden may not be running for president, but he owes it to his dad to keep his promise never to be silent. There was also Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader who threw Clinton a lifeline by suggesting that House Republicans investigation of Benghazi was designed at least in part to bring down her poll numbers. By waiting as long as he did, he gave Clinton her opportunity for political resurrection in the first Democratic debate.",1,1

2303,"(Courtesy of NMSU) New Mexico State University researchers are working to develop innovative new products using glandless cottonseed to increase profitability of the cotton plant, going beyond the traditional uses of fabric and livestock feeds. NMSU is growing shrimp, and will be ready to begin selling them as head-on, whole shrimp in January, through a student-operated company called New Mexico Shrimp Co. NMSU has been working closely with Cotton Inc., a national organization that supports the cotton industry, to brainstorm different possibilities for using the glandless, or gossypol-free, cottonseed. ADVERTISEMENT Some of the products the university is exploring use the seed as a high protein source for human consumption and also as aquaculture feeds. NMSU researchers are looking for new ways to use the seed of glandless cotton plants. We chose shrimp because theyre several times more efficient at converting that protein to an edible product. Maybe a little further down the line, as we improve the variety, and we have higher yielding varieties of this type of cotton, I think the seed could be more valuable than the lint, Carrillo added. Commercial aquaculture feeds contain fishmeal, so theyre not as sustainable as a plant-based protein, because theyre basically taking fish from the ocean and making a meal out of that, and then feeding it to another fish, Carrillo said. Other glandless cottonseed products in various phases of development and marketing related to the project include snack foods and cottonseed oils, offered from Acala Farms ( in flavors such as toasted cumin, fried shallot, fresh cilantro, hot habaero and jalapeo lime among others. Carrillo and his team started out raising Pacific white shrimp, a saltwater shrimp, and have studied different techniques to grow them in large indoor swimming pools, in a zero-exchange, heterotopic aquaculture system. The system reuses water for several shrimp crops, an important consideration for exploring aquaculture production in the desert.

11372,"The House is likely to pass the Harvey aid as a stand-alone bill, but GOP leaders are signaling that the Senate may add the debt increase to it. Ryan said nothing will stop a Harvey aid bill from getting through Congress and he didnt foresee any problems with it passing, despite opposition to federal aid from some Republicans following Superstorm Sandy. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney urged lawmakers in a letter outlining the aid request to act expeditiously to ensure that the debt ceiling does not affect these critical response and recovery efforts. An additional $5 billion to $8 billion for Harvey could be tucked into a catch-all spending bill Congress must pass in the coming weeks to fund the government past Sept. 30, according to the senior House Republican. Billions of dollars in Harvey aid are an unexpected cost that at least raises the potential that Congress would have to act earlier than expected to increase the governments borrowing authority. Congress must act by Sept. 29 to increase the United States $19.9 trillion debt limit, in order to permit the government to continue borrowing money to pay bills like Social Security and interest. The request, expected to be swiftly approved by Congress, would add $7.4 billion to rapidly dwindling Federal Emergency Management Agency disaster aid coffers and $450 million to finance disaster loans for small businesses. Republican leaders are already making plans to use the aid package, certain to be overwhelmingly popular, to win speedy approval of a contentious increase in the federal borrowing limit. For GOP lawmakers who support a straightforward increase in the debt limit, pairing it with Harvey money makes the unpopular vote easier to cast. Trump seeks an initial $7.9 billion in Harvey aid.....................................................................................................................................................................................

8334,"But as Politico suggests, the delay in announcing plans to release the remaining 107 high-risk terrorists is certainly convenient given the mood in the country and abroad: The optics of proceeding with a plan to close the prison camp got uglier after Paris: Republicans, who are now trying to bar Syrian refugees from being let in the United States because of fears spawned by the bloodshed, would likely be even more intense in opposing the closure of the facility often called Gitmo. According to Politico, Pentagon sources say that the costs of transferring the inmates is causing the hold-up, but political pressure is certainly another major factor as many in Congress on both sides of the aisle have been pushing back hard against the administration's efforts to willingly bring terrorists into the U.S. After the Paris attacks, the attorneys general of the targeted states have banded together to block the move: On Wednesday, the attorneys general of Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina sent a letter to Obama that invoked the Paris attacks in urging him not to use executive action to send Guantnamo inmates to their states. As usual, the Obama administration responded in defiance, saying that the horrific events in Paris would not deter their plans to empty Gitmo. Such defiance and contorted logic ( which the administration's used repeatedly) was demonstrated this weekend when the president gave the go ahead to release five more terrorists from Gitmo to the United Arab Emirates just hours after the coordinate Paris attacks. Obama Delays Releasing Plan to Shut Down Gitmo, Claims Paris Has Nothing to Do With It.The Obama administration insists that bad optics did not play into their decision to delay the releasing of the president's plan to shut down the terrorist detainment facility in Guantnamo Bay.

8029,"I do expect that given the implausibility of any outright repeal under this president, or even a subsequent president, because of how entrenched the ACA is in the health system at this point, Republicans in Congress will move on to targeted changes, some of which could have Democratic support, said Michael Kolber, who was an attorney in the general counsels office of the Department of Health and Human Services during Obamas first term. Republicans have already conceded that some planks of the ACA are already broadly accepted by most Americans and unlikely to be repealed by either party: barring insurance companies from charging higher rates to people with illnesses and allowing young people up to age 26 to stay on their parents health care plans. The American people believe both subsidies and mandates are wrong, so its now up to Congress to use reconciliation to repeal Obamacare, and Congress should continue to do so until there is a president who is willing to sign that repeal,"" said David McIntosh, president of the conservative group the Club for Growth. If Republicans accepted the broad outlines of Obamacare, they might shift to calling for more modest changes, such as limiting the number of people eligible for Medicaid under the law or getting rid of its employer mandate. Twenty-one states, all of which have a Republican governor or GOP-controlled state legislature, so far have declined to expand Medicaid to nearly all of their low-income residents, as the law calls for. Americans for Prosperity, the conservative group backed by the Koch brothers, is likely to keep opposing Medicaid expansion and threatening primary challenges to Republicans at the state level who would seek to accept the federal funds. The concerns from conservatives when the ACA passed that the law would halt job growth or balloon Americas health care costs have been so far unfounded. Jeb Bush, one of the leading Republican presidential candidates, talked in a recent interview with the Des Moines Register about embracing the idea of health care exchanges, as set up in the ACA, but giving ""broad discretion to states to create exchanges that would look more like a Republican vision of how you expand access to health care insurance.""",0,2

From a September 29, 2003 Obama press release: Obama challenged the Congress to stand up to the misplaced priorities of this Administration by delaying the $87 billion for Iraq until the President provides a specific plan and timetable for ending the U.S. occupation, justifies each and every dollar to ensure it is not going to reward Bush political friends and contributors, and provides investment in our own schools, health care, economic development and job creation that is at least comparable to what is going to Iraq. He quickly replied with a link for a page on a Clinton campaign website that contains a quote from a speech Obama delivered in November 2003, when he was running for Senate: Just this week, when I was asked, would I have voted for the $87 billion dollars [in a war funding], I said no. But what Sen. Clinton told CNN was that Obama said, Ill never vote for [Iraq war] funding. Did Obama actually vow, as Clinton said, to never vote for funds for the Iraq war?

More from GlobalPost: Obama tests his sway over North Korea Webb acknowledged that the regime's opacity, coupled with limited US human intelligence in the country, has lent extra weight to China's potential role in persuading the North to abandon is long-range missile and uranium enrichment programs, and return to stalled six-party nuclear talks. Jim Webb, who sits on the Senate foreign relations committee, said China needed to step up cooperation with the rest of the world in addressing concerns over North Korea, as the regime in Pyongyang again prepares to defy international opinion with the launch of a long-range rocket within the next two weeks. In an attempt to address criticism of its ""secretive"" missile program, North Korea has invited international observers to the launch, which could take place on any morning between April 12 and 17, according to reports. He ruled out any covert attempts by the US or its allies to sabotage the rocket launch, which will at least give Washington an opportunity to gauge how far North Korea's ballistic rocket technology has advanced over the past three years.

A peripheral figure in the My Lai cover-up, Powell, as Nick Turse, an expert on war crimes in Vietnam, writes me, put together a memorandum for his superiors, in December 1968, that read in part: Although there may be isolated cases of mistreatment of civilians and POWs this by no means reflects the general attitude throughout the [Americal] division. Countrywide, beyond the decrepit health, education, and infrastructure systems, of the estimated over ten thousand civilian deaths at the hands of coalition forces, many would certainly qualify as war crimes as defined in Article 147 of the 4th Geneva Convention as well as Article 3 of the Hague Tribunal statute which was drafted in large part by the U.S. as the basis for trials of war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In fact, a recent New York Times article describing battlefield baptisms of American soldiers taking place in the yard of a Falluja elementary school commandeered by US forces completely missed the fact that seizing the school (not to mention preventing students from continuing their studies) would, under Article 3 of the Hague Tribunal statute and the above mentioned articles of the 4th Geneva Convention, be considered war crimes. From the sorry state of the countrys hospitals, to torture at Abu Ghraib when I was there in March the reality of torture at the prison was already old news to Iraqis to the innumerable civilians killed by coalition forces, even the most modest of tours of the country left one with the feeling that the Americans and British were no better than the Israelis at the game of belligerent occupation. And so to Iraqis and much of the rest of the world but not most shocked Americans the torture photos did not reveal an isolated phenomenon; they reflected a larger well-known structural problem (at the heart of which was the commission of war crimes as defined both by American military manuals and by international law).

7530,"Thats partly because the science stories seem to over-reach, pretending to offer explanations for creativity by finding precise locations for the multitudinous connections that the brain generates. By Jonah Lehrer Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 304 pages Imagine doesnt offer a prescription for how we are to become more imaginative, but it does emphasize some key ingredients of a creative culture: taking education seriously, increasing possibilities for human mixing, and cultivating a willingness to take risks. Lehrer shows why brainstorming usually fails to result in real innovation because nobody is pushing back on bad ideas. Sitting by yourself with your computer, even if you have access to thousands of Facebook friends, just isnt the same as being in a creative, cosmopolitan culture in which new connections are continually (and surprisingly) formed. Lehrer offers fascinating accounts of why cities generate intense creative work, and why certain urban-planning principles that emphasize heterogeneity (think Jane Jacobs) are so powerful. By Jonah Lehrer Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 304 pages Many of the stories that Lehrer recounts in the first few chapters stress the benefits of paying attention to internal mental processes that seem to come from out of the blue. Lehrer adds, Once the ghost arrived, all Dylan wanted to do was get out of the way. He says that working memory is an essential tool of the imagination, and his own little book is an excellent example of how a dynamic storehouse of captivating information feeds creative thinking and writing. Lehrer notes that modern science has given new names to ideas that philosophers have been exploring for a very long time. He quotes Harvard economist Edward Glaeser, who emphasizes that even in this age of technology, we still get smart being around other smart people. Lehrer practices what he preaches, showing an appetite for learning, a determined effort to cross fields and disciplines, and a delight in exploring new possibilities. Glaeser and Lehrer are showing why cities remain so important, but as the president of a university, I can also see how this applies to our campuses.",1,1
1228,"Kevin Price of the Iowa-based drone company RoboFlight Systems says that kind of precision would put farmers at a huge advantage, helping them reduce the costs of chemicals and their application. The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, a trade group, says agriculture could account for 80 percent of all commercial drone use, once government regulations allow it. Matt Scassero, the project director, says the idea is that a laser-based sensor mounted on a drone would allow scientists to see through the water and measure the size of a school of fish. Drone technology, already used in other countries, can make farmers more efficient by helping them locate problem spots in vast fields or ranchlands. Five ways drones could affect the food supply: SCOUTING FARMS Advertisement The first agriculture drones are looking at massive fields of crops to scout out where crops are too wet, too dry, too diseased or too infested with pests. Drones could help ranchers count cattle, disturb pests that are aggravating livestock or even apply insecticide to an animal. ___ APPLYING CHEMICALS Once the land is surveyed, farmers could use that data to narrow the areas that need treatment. Increased efficiency could mean lower costs for consumers and less impact on the environment if farmers used fewer chemicals because drones showed them exactly where to spray. Farmers hope that they eventually could use drones to do the spraying. Alabama farmer Don Glenn said he would buy a drone or use a service that provides drone surveillance on his farm of corn, wheat, soybeans and canola. The Federal Aviation Administration has been working for years on rules that would balance the desire for commercial flights of small drones with the need to prevent collisions involving manned aircraft. When it comes to drones, ""your imagination can go pretty wild in terms of what would be possible,"" says Roger Johnson, president of the National Farmers Union.",1,3

Obama Shows Trump What A Classy Father’s Day Message Looks Like After Trump’s Twitter Meltdown.Donald Trump has been consumed with a seething anger and frustration lately thats slipping into everything he does. Meanwhile, former President Obama whose popularity has only risen since handing the office over to Trump put on a masterclass of how to handle a simple Fathers Day tweet. On Fathers Day, a time most Americans were taking as an opportunity to honor and remember their dads, Trump was on Twitter lying about Obama. And lest Trump supporters think Obama is only doing this now that hes retired heres how Obama marked Fathers Day last year while president.

Trumps unhinged rant about Obamas poll numbers got a measly third of that. According to aides, Trump is barely coherent, ranting at television screens and mad at the people investigating him. This week, his Twitter messages rose to an even more disgusting level of vitriol as the scandals and crimes his administration has perpetuated continue to come to light.

And the evidence that Zimmerman acted in self-defense is strong enough that he should be able to prevail under the standard of proof applicable in a civil case. Even so, Alan Dershowitz, who followed the criminal case closely, isn't sure ""where you'll find a lawyer who is prepared to bring [a suit], because it has very little chance of success."" One should never underestimate the creativity of over-zealous civil rights lawyers, but I doubt there is a plausible theory under which it can maintained that Zimmerman violated Martin's civil rights as defined by federal law. It was no accident that the prosecution in the criminal case backed away from the theory that Zimmerman acted out of racial animus. Thus, a scenario in which DOJ comes out of the shadows and takes the lead in the further persecution of George Zimmerman is also plausible. Let's also keep in mind the fact of the jury's verdict in the state case. One place where we might find such a lawyer is in Eric Holder's Department of Justice. He also believes that, if it does bring a case, the case will not succeed. Zimmerman also broke no federal law by following Trayvon Martin in furtherance of the former's neighborhood patrol role. In addition, the plaintiff could force Zimmerman to testify. It would be nice to believe, as Dershowitz seems to, that Holder is simply trying to appease the race-mongers in the aftermath of a verdict they hate, and that ultimately he will let the matter fade.",1,3

Nevertheless, President Obamas unwillingness to unseal classified documents purportedly linking the Saudis to 9/11 have led many to question the White Houses commitment to seeking justice for the American victims of terrorist attacks. But this has been a process which we generally reveal with through the intelligence community and Jim Clapper, our director of National Intelligence, has been going through to make sure that whatever it is that is released is not going tp compromise some major national security interest of the United States. In a a sworn affidavit delivered to a federal court in 2012, Graham explicitly stated: ""I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11 attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia.""

8699,"ADVERTISEMENT A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board said the plane had just taken on 40 gallons of the wrong fuel at the airport, but the report did not say the fuel was the cause of the crash. Suit filed in air ambulance crash that caused 4 deaths..................................................................................................................................................................................... Federal investigators say the aircraft was filled with the wrong type of fuel before it crashed. The pilot gave a Southwest Aviation technician a verbal order for 40 gallons of fuel, which was put into two tanks, and the aircraft took off. Mike Carey, director of operations for Amigos Aviation, said he was not sure his company had seen the suit. One or both engines failed because they had been fueled with Jet A fuel dispensed by Southwest instead of the required 100LL aviation gasoline. Also killed in the crash were pilot Freddy Martinez, 29, flight paramedic Tauren Summers, 27, and nurse Monica Chavez, 35. Shortly after becoming airborne, however, the aircraft began trailing smoke, state the court documents. Green was staying with an older brother in Las Cruces while undergoing radiation treatment for a brain tumor but his condition had deteriorated and doctors decided he should return to the Phoenix hospital where he was first treated. That directive required a modification of the fuel filler opening to preclude misfueling of the airplane resulting in engine failure, the directive says. The engine failure caused the aircraft to crash, killing all four persons on board. A manager at Southwest Aviation, who would not give his name, said he had no comment on the lawsuit and would not say if the company had an attorney.

The transparently biased mental health professionals attempting to act like neutral arbitrators then delve directly into spreading fake news itself while conveniently leaving out anything to do with Antifa which we now know is an actual domestic terrorist orgranization that openly targets Trump supporters. The letter,#160; published#160;by various liberal news outlets, essentially claims that numerous Trump policies, supported by over 60 million Americans, has led to an increase in extreme mental pain for those who voted for the losing candidate. This kind of hatred has always been with us, but it has been inflamed by President Trump, who claimed to be a president for all Americans, but who has declined to take a moral stance on bigotry and instead has set up a situation in which there are apparently two legitimate sides. The rest of the letter continues to paint Trump and tens of millions of Americans as perpetrators of crimes against all sorts of groups of people while continuing to push misinformation on statements and actions actually made by the president. The#160;letter then turns to even more lies, this time about DACA and what Trumps stance is on the controversial executive action taken by the former Obama Administration.

6930,"The film ""Son of Saul"" is about one of those Sonderkommandos, a fictional creation who thinks he comes across his own son among the dead. He details how a cultured nation went insane, how ordinary soldiers became mass killers and how the churches of Germany looked the other way as the innocent were murdered. ""Son of Saul"" won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival and it will undoubtedly win many other awards - not, in case you're wondering, just out of treacly respect for the subject matter and the director's noble intentions, but because it is a startling work of genius. One young man survived the gassing and is promptly killed. ""Son of Saul"" has the staying power of a loved one's death. Really, everything perished at Auschwitz, including, out of necessity, the hideous implications of the place. For a time, some churchmen protested the Nazis' euthanasia program for the sick and the mentally disabled, a precursor to the Holocaust that the Germans visited upon themselves. Even in the waning days of the war, the Germans kept up the killing, enthralled by Hitler and convinced by the bizarre logic of anti-Semitism that, if they didn't kill the Jews, the Jews would kill them. I felt closer to the Holocaust in this film than I have in any other or, even, in the many books I've read. I cannot rid myself of the visual stench of ""Son of Saul."" The grandparents of the thoroughly admirable Germans of today did the killing. He, like director Laszlo Nemes, are native Hungarians, which is appropriate because the movie ends in 1944 with the arrival at Auschwitz of transports from Hungary.",0,0

Unsecured creditors would get about 65 percent of the value of their claims, Fish said. Southwest Brands had agreed to dramatically up its bid too, Fish said, but the committee decided the Bernsteins offer was ultimately better. That does not necessarily mean the Bernsteins plan will get confirmed by a judge, Fish said. Fish said the matter ultimately came down to what was better for the unsecured creditors, a group he said has $3.8 million in claims. Asked why she didnt offer more with the initial plan, Bernstein said it was the nature of the process, calling it an auction essentially. The unsecured creditors committee in Flying Stars U.S. Bankruptcy Court case has agreed to withdraw a reorganization plan that would involve selling Flying Star as a going operation to Southwest Brands. You dont know until you get other bidders in, Bernstein said. As part of a settlement reached Wednesday, the committee also has agreed not to challenge a reorganization plan proposed by Flying Star owners Jean and Mark Bernstein, said Paul Fish, the committees attorney. I think that Southwest Brands was probably positioned better than anybody to maintain the brands integrity, and well see what happens, he said. While it would have covered some claims in full, the unsecured creditors would have received an estimated 21.5 cents on the dollar.

In its most expensive operation in history, the CIA gathered the most savage and fanatical people it could find, trained and armed them, and set them loose in Afghanistan in the 1970s, even before the Soviets invaded that now ruined country. Suppose that the effective government of Afghanistan, say, although it said that it was willing to turn over Osama bin Laden to a court if the US produces evidence, refuses the Security Councils demand to do so. If no appropriate court could be found, then one could be created, as they were for the Lockerbie terrorist attack and the Balkan war crimes. Instead, the US has launched a war that may result in the deaths of millions in the next few months. A practical program for (a) would have been: Before killing anyone, take the matter to the UN Security Council, as the US is bound to do by treaty, and insist on the delivery to a court of justice of anyone responsible for the crimes. Rather than purposely flouting it, the US should have (a) used the resources of domestic and international law to apprehend and prosecute anyone left alive who was responsible for this crime; and (b) made an effort to understand the causes, motives, and reasons for the crime so that they can be removed, lessening the chance of a repetition. The latter group of terrorists are the American officials who complacently contemplate the starvation of millions of people in Afghanistan in the next few weeks in what United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson has called a humanitarian disaster on the scale of Rwanda in the mid-1990s.

The double-digit selloff is the latest in a series of steep declines for Marvell, leaving its shares down almost 47% year-to-date. Earlier this year disappointing earnings and guidance from Marvell triggered double-digit declines for Marvells stock. Continue Reading Below The selling began Wednesday afternoon after a jury ruled against Marvell in a patent infringement case that was unleashed by Carnegie Mellon University. Marvell now faces a steep fine of $1.17 billion in damages, which would make it one of the largest civil patent penalties in history. A federal jury agreed with the schools claims that Marvell infringed on patents related to technology aimed at making hard drive circuits more effective at understanding data contained in high-speed magnetic disks. By also finding the infringement was willful, its possible the trial judge could triple the damages, published reports said. That marks Marvells lowest close since March 2009 just as the markets bottomed after the Great Recession. Wall Street punished the companys shares, sending them tumbling as low as $7.19 during intraday trading before closing at $7.40, down 10.30% on the day.

The failure of the Bandung Conference to launch a permanent Asian-African countries organisation was a sign that it was the writ of the imperialist powers that ultimately prevailed, although Nehru did make a valiant attempt later to revive it in the form of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1961. Consequently, hostilities ended on May 7, 1949 and an agreement was signed to hold further negotiations at a round table conference under the auspices of the United Nations Nehru Refuses to Buckle Another development that had important bearing on shaping India s foreign policy was Nehrus visit to the United States in October 1949. While other countries were more concerned about working out truce in Indo-China, the U.S. was busy making preparations to convene a conference of South East Asian countries at Manila to found a new military alliance to which members of the Colombo Powers were also invited. As the Colombo Conference in May 1954 had already taken a decision to hold a conference of Asian and African countries, Nehru wasted no time in confronting the aggressive stance of the United States by inviting the Indonesian Prime Minister to Delhi to discuss preparations for the proposed conference. Failure to obtain U.S. economic aid without political strings and because of the general foreign policy of the United States of suppressing national liberation movements in Asia, relations between India and the United States began to sour. Thus, India stepped in to make a notable contribution in bringing about ceasefire in the Indo-China war on July 21, 1954, although India was present only in an unofficial capacity at the Geneva talks. While India initially supported the UN Security Council resolution that enabled the U.S. to intervene in the Korean War under the flag of the United Nations, India refused to give any military support and only sent a medical team on a humanitarian mission.

2038,"The United States Is Innocent and Has Never Killed Anyone.As Trump pursues policies of ""stealing oil"" and ""killing families"" he is adding nothing new to the United States' record. It was bound to be the case that if a U.S. president ever admitted that the United States murdered people and did so on a scale at least as significant as other countries, he would be defending the practice, not denouncing it. During this last presidency, the United States developed a new policy of murdering people with missiles from drones. During this past U.S. election, a debate moderator asked if a candidate would be willing to kill thousands of innocent children as part of basic presidential duties. So, when someone like Donald Trump, who pushes lies and disasters like theyre going out of style, blurts out some truth, Democratic partisans are eager to denounce it. As he pursues policies of stealing oil and killing families he is adding nothing new to the United States record. The United States is the top weapons dealer, the top weapons buyer, the biggest military spender, the most widespread imperial presence, the most frequent war maker, the most prolific overthrower of governments, and from 1945 to 2017 the killer of the most people through war.

The big news was the launch of a new family of sequencers that could reenergize sales of high-end instruments, something that investors were hoping for and that I discussed as a possibility Opens a New Window. Low-volume customers were able to get whole genome sequencing on the desktop midrange product for one-third the instrument price. Illumina bears believe that the company has hit a wall of demand for sequencing and that the need for new instruments and supplies will inevitably grow slowly from here. And given the lower operating costs of the new machines, usage will need to increase just to keep revenue flat. Further, the sales cycle could be lengthy as research labs try to understand the new product and adapt their processes and supplies inventory in preparation for its use. A revamp of the high end of the instrument line was exactly what Illumina needed to get growth back on track. This technology will remain the core building block for new high-end instruments for years to come. With the entry cost of NovaSeq below $1 million, new customers should appear. The new line, called NovaSeq, will likely renew the company's growth, but not immediately.

821,"Even if Trump sticks to his promise, the fact that it was a multilateral agreement, in which America is just one of seven governments involved, limits the Trump administration's options: Assuming that Iran remains compliant with the JCPOAs terms, no one expects the Europeans to re-impose sanctions on Iran, even if the U.S. chooses to impose its own in response to ongoing ballistic missile tests, sponsorship of State Department-designated terrorist organizations such as Lebanese Hezbollah, and/or human rights abuses. Well, Here's One Guy Who's More Than Willing to Help..Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is offering his help to Donald Trump should he follow through with his vow to dismantle the Iran nuclear deal. Stressing that he personally knows Trump and his attitude toward Israel, Netanyahu suggested that the new Trump administration would likely be willing to take some significant steps to undo the infamous Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which infused the terror-sponsoring Iran with $140 billion and only at best slowed their goal of creating nuclear weapons. At an AIPAC meeting in March Trump announced that his ""number-one priority"" upon taking office is ""to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran."" It is also important to remember that even after Trump takes office, the rule of law will still prevail and Trump (and his Republican majority-controlled Congress) have many other priorities that will take precedence over the JCPOA and Americas relationship with Iran. Netanyahu underscored that he and President Obama had some significant ""differences of opinion,"" particularly about the Iran deal. That said, if the U.S. Congress votes to nullify the agreement and Trump formally does so, the other participants to the Agreement (most importantly, Iran) will no doubt be forced to consider the implications of such action on both the sanctity of the Agreement as well as the degree to which it is likely to remain in force should sanctions be re-imposed by Washington. For more on the ""disastrous"" Iran deal, read conservative author Dennis Prager's discussion of "" what's wrong with Obama's case for the Iran deal."" ""I know Donald Trump, and I",1,3

Likewise, investors see the OPEC deal fueling higher activity levels offshore, which could lead to more work for Hornbeck and Bristow, as well as driving demand for petroleum product vessels. Investors see OPEC's decision as a game changer for offshore companies because it might push oil prices high enough to boost offshore drilling activities, which could mean more work for Bristow's helicopters and Hornbeck's service vessels. Investors hope that Trump's new EPA head will cut the regulatory burden that has been holding back profits at independent refiners CVR Energy and PBR Energy. Those moves are a continuation of their sharp rallies since OPEC agreed to step in to support oil prices at the end of November, with Hornbeck, for example, now up more than 80%. Fueling that rally was Trump's pledge to pull back regulations that have been hurting American businesses, including Environmental Protection Agency regulations that have decimated independent U.S. refiners.

However, Comcast has a leg up on Disney when it comes to promoting the Tonight Show-themed ride in that it owns the property, a rare role reversal in this battle for tourism dollars. Disney, on the other hand, rarely delves outside of its owned properties, and the few times that it has gone this route -- Star Wars, The Muppets, Indiana Jones -- it has eventually acquired the intellectual property outright.

See Clinton's 'Love And Kindness' On Display With Somali Leftist.Hillary Clintons poll-tested campaign messaging has recently decided to include calls for more love and kindness in American politics. In August of last year, Clinton demonstrated similar impatience with Black Lives Matter activists, calling for the iron fist of government to impose racial justice in lieu of changing hearts. Hilariously, Clinton herself has attempted to court these people via racial grievance mongering, invoking nonsense terms such as mass incarceration and exploiting the deaths of faux racial martyrs such as Trayvon Martin, Michael, Eric Garner, and Jordan Davis. During unscripted moments where the Democratic front-runner loses cognizance of her behavior being unrecorded, Clinton seems to fall short of her own recommendations when dealing with member of her own political support base. Framing Somali youth as stigmatized, the woman asks Clinton about being accountable to black people. Racial agitators have sought to frame the ""super-predator"" comments as being predicated on anti-black racism, and have called for racial quotas in jurisprudence in order to reduce the numbers of incarcerated black criminals.

A former civil servant, Kilicdaroglu swept to the leadership of the main secular opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP) last spring amid a sex-tape scandal that ousted the long-standing (and clean-shaven) party chairman, Deniz Baykal. Perhaps what is most important to Erdogan's appeal is the way in which he represents a shift away from the traditional vanguards of Turkey's political system. But his intentions for the party are anything but meek - in less than a year as his party's leader he has attempted to shift his image from the anti-revolutionary to a modern, forward-thinking alternative to Erdogan. If he does win, he will become the longest-running Turkish prime minister since legitimate elections - ones that weren't blatantly manipulated by the ruling party - began in 1950. This time around though, the leading opposition candidate, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, is banking on a secret weapon - and it's plastered right in the center of his round-faced mug.

To his credit, Mr. Dorfman uses his piece, in a close parallel to his 9/11 essay, to push for self-reflection on the part of the exceptional nation, and, one can only hope (probably in vain), an end to our countrys baldfaced interference in the affairs of other nations. Right here in CounterPunch, in an article published on October 3, 2001, and titled Americas No Longer Unique, Mr. Dorfman expressed grief and sympathy for the lives lost, while also pleading for a compassionate response from a country that had just experienced what other, less fortunate peoples had experienced before; an America that had just had the bubble of its famous exceptionalism burst. When Mr. Trump denies, as do his acolytes, the claims by the intelligence community that the election was, in fact, rigged in his favor by a foreign power, he is bizarrely echoing the very responses that so many Chileans got in the early 70s when we accused the C.I.A.

The diverse, community service integrated ministries of this summer is the church showing (volunteers) where this is happening in our midst, she said. Stephanie Gans, a Jewish graduate of William and Mary who will help establish the day laborer center at Centerville, said she loves consensus and is so impressed with how the volunteers were arriving at consensus despite their diversity. To develop an intimate faith community volunteers are to devote 80 percent of their work week to the community ministries of their host; 20 percent to congregational ministries and add several hours for faith conversations in the community. Schaller-Blaufuss said one of the benefits of summer missions is vocational discernment. In Chicago, volunteers will live in and work out of Ellis Avenue Baptist Church, which is in a 100-year-old house. Last year a volunteer said, I never knew I had kindred spirits in Baptist life until she became involved in the collaborative project. #160;This will be a setting where the church can learn how to be the church in a different way, said Schaller-Blaufuss. Metro Baptist Church in New York will utilize volunteers in urban ministries, where they will interact with people on either side of their New York City Dream, said host pastor Alan Sherouse. Their involvement also encourages the churches to which they are assigned and helps churches see their role in developing a missions mindset in young people. Diversity is manifest in the volunteer group in gender, age and education and even includes a Jewish social work graduate who is fluent in Spanish and will work with a day laborer ministry.

I recommend taking a deeper look at this slow and steady growth story and seeing if BJ's deserves a place in your portfolio. Lessons learned and improvements made to the business over the past half-decade along with a favorable valuation should make this stock a winner going forward.

5214,"I myself think the reason why Casey made Bob Gates his deputy in 1986 is he needed someone who was involved in all the operational matters of Iran-Contra as some security fence within the bureaucracy, someone who knew all of this stuff and could protect it. On the basis of that one raw report Casey wanted a sensitive assessment prepared that would be given only to about a half-dozen senior leaders, including the president and the vice president, and he turned to Gates, who was the DDI [deputy director for intelligence], and said, Get this done. When Gates appears before the Senate Armed Services Committee this week, hes unlikely to face the level of scrutiny he did in 1991 when 31 Democratic Senators voted against him or, for that matter, in 1987, when lingering questions about his role in Iran-Contra forced him to withdraw from the confirmation process altogether. And, of course, this gets into the whole issue of what Gates knew about Iran-Contra and the fact that no one on the intelligence committee believed him in 1987 when he said he knew nothing about it. He didnt want controversy with the military, so he started sending areas of tactical military intelligence over to the Pentagon, got the CIA out of the business of order of battle intelligence, which is really an unfortunate setback. They had been blasted by [General Norman] Schwarzkopf, and Gates called Colin Powell, the chairman of the joint chiefs, to try to get a two- and three-star general to come over to the CIA as a deputy director to further form links between the military, the Pentagon, and the CIA on intelligence matters. But Gates had sort of conspired with the national intelligence officer for the Middle East, Graham Fuller, to try and prepare a memo that would justify Iran-Contra.

Nobody in the real world had to watch MSNBC to know we were worried about Muslim terrorists except for the president of the United States, who finds out about IRS corruption, Obamacare failures, Fast and Furious, the Department of Justice wiretapping reporters, the Department of Veteran Affairs screwing veterans, and Clinton email scandals from the boob tube. You Won't BELIEVE Why Obama Says He Didn't React Strongly Enough to Paris, San Bernardino.According to a later-scrubbed New York Times story, President Obama doesnt understand Americans worries about terror fears. Just as amazing, Obama sees anyone who opposes his fecklessness as a conspiratorial racist opposed to him on a personal level. For President Obama not to understand Americans fears after 130 Westerners were gunned down by Muslim terrorists, and then to doubly not understand those fears after 14 Americans were gunned down by Muslim terrorists simply demonstrates Obamas blind spot for Islamic terrorism. The original Times story, before the memory-holing, included this passage: In his meeting with the columnists, Mr. Obama indicated that he did not see enough cable television to fully appreciate the anxiety after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and made clear that he plans to step up his public arguments. If the only standard for activity demanding a crushing response is that which poses an existential threat, we might as well disband our military now which, it seems, is Obamas plan. Obama thinks that Islamic terror is a mere annoyance. Its never his fault that his administration routinely hampers terror investigations for the sake of political correctness its that everyone is a closet racist.

In his wisdom-laden book, The Prophetic Imagination, Walter Brueggemann writes, The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us. As followers of Jesus, there is a fierce urgency for us to work for the common good, or our faith looks rather flaccid. Our time summons us out of Christian quietism to public advocacy for justice, a hopeful form of resistance to the dominant culture. It is not surprising that it is a small congregation; many folks are just plain scared of that much grace and of finding common humanity with radical otherness. Always linking prophetic witness with hope, he adds: Hope is the refusal to accept the reading of reality which is the majority opinion and hope is subversive, for it limits the grandiose pretension of the present, daring to announce that the present to which we have all made commitments is now called into question. More often we scurry into our little tribes and presume that our own culture is the normative one. He calls us beyond moral and ethical dwarfism to prophetic hope, which Scripture richly funds. Being a part of an upper-middle class church, I was oblivious to the abyss of poverty many endured, and I failed to see the demographic lines. This was storied Little Rock history, but the lingering effects of the conflict shaped much of civic life, and pernicious racism continued.

Maine Contract Farming, formerly the DeCoster Egg Farm, has a three decade-long complaint history from workers, neighbors, environmental officials, labor officials and humane workers. (The conditions in this migrant farm site are as dangerous and oppressive as any sweatshop we have seen, said Labor Secretary Robert Reich; I thought I was going to faint and I was only there a few minutes, said Cesar Britos, an attorney representing DeCoster workers, after entering a barn.)

In this opinion piece, Ted Belman argued that the threat of rockets raining down on Israel from Gaza isnt nearly the threat that the peace process was and is because peace talks would require Israeli concessions. The panel was to have made a collective call for the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit, the beginning of a process to release all Palestinian prisoners and the immediate start of negotiations with Hamas on the framework for a peace deal based on 1967 borders. A Way Out of the Gaza Crisis?.Out of sight of the international press pack, a bid to resolve the Gaza crisis, involving a dialogue between a Jewish religious leader and Hamas representatives, is ongoing and well advanced. They would also have announced that Jewish and Muslim religious leaders could achieve peace where Israels politicians had failed.

Yet Froman is on record as saying he has more in common with my brothers and sisters in Hamas than with secular Israelis. Some believe that Israels re-invasion of Gaza was a similar provocation aimed at bringing down the Hamas government and preventing a unified Palestinian negotiating stance based on the prisoners document. It was scuppered by an inconvenient phone call from the then-interior minister, Gideon Ezra, and a deterioration in Arafats health which, by the following day, had rendered him unable to take visitors. It involved Arafat signing off on an independent Palestinian state and permanent religious ceasefire, the latter with the support of key Israeli civic and religious leaders.

If that conclusion is confirmed, the man's death would be the first outside of the U.S. or Malaysia attributed to Takata. The U.S. version of the 2007 CR-V also has been recalled to replace both driver and passenger inflators, but it has a different type of inflator than the one used in Australia, the company said. Three other people in the Australian wreck, including a passenger in the CR-V and two people in the Toyota, were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life threatening, according to police. Authorities in Australia and the U.S. have urged people to go to government or automaker websites to check if their vehicles have been recalled and to take them in for repairs as soon as possible.

2969,"In fact, GM has kept its dividend stable even during very good years, choosing to return additional excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases instead Opens a New Window.. Why? Can General Motors Sustain Its 4.3% Dividend?.In the last several months, value investors looking for strong dividend yields have seen Detroit-based giant General Motors (NYSE: GM) turn up more frequently in their searches. This is a near-term concern, but it has almost certainly put substantial pressure on GM's share price: Auto sales are cyclical, and the current cycle -- at least in the U.S., and possibly in China as well -- is likely past its cyclical peak. An investor who buys here and commits to reinvesting that dividend might need to be patient through a downturn, but could be very happy with the result once auto sales (and GM's profits and stock price) recover. With a 4.3% dividend yield at current prices, and what looks at first glance to be strong profitability, it seems like GM might be worth some investigation. And its profitability has improved substantially over the last few years: While GM historically swung to losses during recessions, it's possible that it will stay profitable next time around. GM's plan is to maintain the dividend at current levels through a downturn as long as its cash balance is positive. Long story short: The disruption threat is still vague and probably overblown, at least when it comes to GM. But he frankly acknowledged that GM's profits will shrink substantially Opens a New Window. But there's no escaping the economic cycle: Sooner or later, the economy will head south, and GM's profits will shrink substantially. The recession threat is real (it's inevitable), but unless it's a dire, protracted economic mess, GM is likely to sail through it. We can blame GM's recall disaster Opens a New Window.",1,3

Yet if they attack the GOPers on jobs, theyll have to be able to present a strong case that they can do better, and the last election shows how much of a challenge that can be. Thats a shame, because with 15 million unemployed and the recovery sputtering slight, we really do need new thinking and a sense of urgency on behalf of both the unemployed and the economy. Sadly, the most significant employment crisis in generations has stopped generating new thinking and has become simply another opportunity to bash the other party while pushing your perennial agenda. The GOP plan boiled down to its essence is rather retro: Roll back regulation, lower taxes, pass free trade agreements, shrink the US debt, and boost energy production. Reading the House Republican Plan for Americas Job Creators ( PDF), released by the House GOP leadership, is an exercise in wonderment:#160;you wonder what the GOPers actually propose.

3750,"Rather, Coxs idea is designed to make it easier for average Californians, whatever their political persuasion, to know their elected officials and influence public policy. Initiative would create citizen Legislature.JULY 8, 2011 By STEVEN GREENHUT A former Republican presidential candidate and long-time political reformer said Wednesday that he plans on leading a statewide initiative effort designed to expand the number of politicians in the state by reducing the size of political districts for Assembly and state Senate candidates. Heres an initiative that might get mocked at first, but upon closer examination it makes an inordinate amount of sense and should appeal to people from every political persuasion who are seriously interested in reform. In the current system, he said, voting percentages are declining because people know there is no way they can affect the political process. Californias districts are so enormous that there is little chance for average voters to know their representative or to have any influence. A key point is that the legislators would not get full-time staff and big budgets as they do now. But it does offer a specific threat to special interests, and unions in particular, which will be sure to campaign against Coxs initiative, if he raises the funds to get it on the ballot. He foresees a very large Legislature and an executive council for each body similar in size to the current Legislature that would do much of the day-to-day work. Theres an elected representative in New Hampshires house for every 3,290 of that states residents, which is the best level of representation in the nation. Cox said the initiative language, still being discussed, would probably be something like this: The size of districts shall be no more than 10,000 people for the Assembly and 20,000 for the Senate. Unlike many other reforms, such as the ones advocated by moderate business groups such as the Bay Area Council (constitutional convention, open primary, majority-vote budgets, etc. These citizen legislators would better understand the needs of their constituents and would be less likely to serve as the cats paw for unions and big corporations.",0,2
9862,"The charge that Putin was behind Litvinenkos death seems to have originated with Boris Berezovsky, one of the Russian Jewish oligarchs who had grabbed the lions share of privatized Soviet assets during Yeltsins presidency. If such a device were exploded somewhere in the United States, Bush, Cheney, and the neocon nazis would have their second new Pearl Harbor to justify their planned attack on Iran. Despite the NIE report that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program several years ago and despite no signs of a weapons program having been uncovered by IAEA inspectors, Bush, Cheney, and the neocon nazis continue to agitate for striking Iran before it is too late. We know for a fact that the Bush regime created false evidence, lied, and deceived in order to attack Iraq. Epstein suggests that the purpose of the extradition request was to block the Russian government from investigating Litvinenkos death in London. The media used the Litvinenko case as sensational propaganda against Russian President Putin and then tossed it aside. Anyone who is not deaf, blind and stupid knows that the Bush regime is doing everything it can to create circumstances that will permit a US attack on Iran. A real investigtion might have opened up the shadowy world of security consultants in which Litvinenko rubbed shoulders with former British police and intelligence officials. Those who have attempted to clue in fellow citizens are invariably frustrated, because Americans have been trained to dismiss the messenger who brings news of false flag events as a conspiracy theorist. The British government sent the request despite the facts that there is no extradition treaty between Britain and Russia and the Russian constitution prohibits the extradition of Russian citizens. The effort to link Putin and the FSB to Litvinenkos death might be a tale designed to cover-up a more serious crime in the making.

The Chicago Police Department declined to comment on the study, and the Cook County States Attorneys Office could not be reached. Report: Cook County leads nation in exonerations, false confessions.Cook County has a long history of false confessions resulting in wrongful convictions. And its likely theyre better informed about Cook County because its home to Northwestern, and a high number of lawyers and organizations in the region are engaged with the issue and willing to work pro-bono. Taylor, who was 17 and in federal custody at the time, was released last June after spending two decades in prison. Released Tuesday, the report is based on 1,281 recorded exonerations, which were discovered through research from when the program began in May 2012 to the end of 2013. He filed a federal lawsuit this week alleging Chicago police coerced a confession from him and manufactured evidence in the 1992 murder of Jeffery Lassiter and Sharon Haugabook. False confessions accounted for nearly 40 percent of the countys wrongful convictions. But state of justice in Cook County may not be as bleak as those figures indicate. This is a problem that has not been adequately addressed, said Rob Warden, executive director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University School of Law, which partnered with University of Michigan Law School to form the registry.

Greg Adams, a former state senator and lobbyist for the Nebraska Community College Association, said community colleges use data to recruit new students and promote dual enrollment programs for high school students.

If anyone needed a reminder of how important it is to elect a Democratic president, Clinton argued last weekend, look at the Supreme Court. Its more important to you to get these ideas out, one reporter asked Sanders, than to contest the Democratic nomination? As a result Clinton has been forced to rely more than ever on a dryly pragmatic case for her nomination: only she can defeat the Republicans in November. Yet unfortunately for Clinton, most actual Americans do not inhabit the pundit class, and their professional credentials do not depend on gravely denying the existence of puppies, rainbows, and successful single-payer health programs. But after this half-step to the left, Clinton has spent the winter furiously digging an ideological trench between herself and Sanders opposing his major Wall Street reforms, attacking his proposed tax increases, and declaring that single-payer health care will never, ever happen. Not only has Sanders emerged as a serious threat to capture the nomination his victory in New Hampshire was the largest in primary history but his impact on the shape of the campaign has been almost the opposite of what experts imagined. While Clinton continues to talk up her personal credentials as a progressive, in substantive terms the primary campaign has deepened rather than narrowed the ideological gulf between the two candidates. Her forthright opposition to the Sanders agenda has won Clinton praise from some liberal elites, unable to disguise their hostility toward even the most basic social-democratic reforms. Last fall, Sanderss early momentum may have pushed an ambivalent Clinton to reject the Keystone Pipeline and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

Colectivo Unidad Color Rosa, a trans advocacy group in San Pedro Sula, the countrys second largest city, has met with local police officers and soldiers to make them more sensitive to LGBT-specific issues. Thursdays meeting took place a day before more than 200 LGBT rights advocates from throughout the Western Hemisphere will gather in Tegucigalpa for a regional conference the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund co-organized. Nahomy Otero, a trans woman who lives in the city, told the Irish Times in May that trans Hondurans face torture and other abuse from police officers and other public security agents. Local LGBT rights advocates on Oct. 1, 2015, said during a conference they organized that religious officials remain a barrier to expanding LGBT rights in the country.

12989,"Pawlenty seemed stumped by how to respond to this ugly truth about his so-called pro-growth plan: PAWLENTY: We have achieved 5 percent growth twice in the recent history of this country. Conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote, I love tax cuts as much as the next conservative, but[this plan] is not a very serious budget policy. Chris Wallace Schools Pawlenty: 5 Percent Growth Came After Tax Increases.Republican presidential contender and former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty may have been expecting a friendly reception when he sat down for an interview this morning with Fox News Chris Wallace. As Wallace pointed out, there have only been two times in recent history when the U.S. has achieved 5 percent growthand they both came after tax increases. The Fox host hammered Pawlenty on his recently releasedand fantastically unrealisticeconomic plan, which slashes taxes for corporations and millionaires while assuming unrealistic growth estimates. And as Wallace pointed out, its not just liberals and moderates who are dismissing this plan as a pipe dreamPawlentys fellow conservatives think its foolhardy too. But the fact is, the difference is, in both of those occasions that was coming directly out of a recession, not after a year, a year into a weak recovery. You talk about the fact that for a few years in the 80s and a few years in the 90s that we did have average 5 percent growthor close to it, it was 4 point something. [] WALLACE: But governor, is it declinist to doubt the 5 percent number or is it just a realist to doubt the 5 percent number? Pawlentys plan would cost $7.8 trillion, or triple the size of the Bush tax cuts, and explode the deficit. Just this morning, conservative columnist George Will added his voice to the chorus of dissent, saying sustained 5% growth will not happen.

7969,"For example, among those in favor of repealing the law, 38 percent changed their minds after hearing that it would mean people with pre-existing medical conditions could be denied insurance. The results are surprising because President-elect Donald Trumps promise to repeal and replace the health-care law has been one of his clearest policy positions, reinforced by the announcement this week that he had chosen one of its fiercest critics to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Finally, the poll examined how people might react to particular changes that could occur if the health law were to be repealed and replaced. But Altman noted that if Trumps health care team also attempts significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, it could make current-day controversies seem mild. According to the poll, 81 percent had unfavorable opinions about the Affordable Care Act and half wanted to see it repealed. ADVERTISEMENT The drop doesnt mean people flipped to favoring the law; instead, there was an increase in the number of Republicans who thought scaling back the law was a good idea. Nearly a fifth changed their mind after hearing that 20 million people, who gained insurance through the expansion of Medicaid and by buying insurance on the exchanges set up by the law, would lose coverage. For example, more than two-thirds of Trump voters said they liked the health insurance exchanges where people can shop for insurance, the financial help the law provides to low- and moderate-income families to help pay for insurance, the elimination of out-of-pocket costs for preventive medical care and the ability of young adults to stay on their parents health plan. According to the data, collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 69 percent of Republicans supported repealing President Obamas signature health care law in October; a month later, only about half supported a full repeal. Overall, the data show that Americans remain stubbornly divided on the future of the health care law. About half the public want to see the law remain as is or be expanded; 43 percent want to see it repealed or scaled back. The caution here for repealers is that,",0,0

5186,"The devils of politics have always been in the details, and in recent American politics the details have been jiggered to favor incumbent congressmen and state legislators, many of them charmingly mediocre. In other words, American election laws are basically a contract between the Democrats and Republicans in office to preserve each other and keep outsiders where they belong, outside. Democrats, Republicans, independents and oddballs of various kinds will all be on the same ballot, and the top two finishers, even if they are in the same party, will run against each other in the general election. That system has been used in various Southern states in the past, but the official Citizens Commission is another California innovation. Next, the commission five Republicans, five Democrats and four independents will look at the maps theyve made and vote again. They had the power, and still do in most states, to craftily craft districts to make it difficult to unseat incumbents of either party. There were 30,000 applicants for these $300-a-day jobs, and the lottery wheel spun for the first time Thursday and the first balls that popped out named eight of the 14: a bookstore owner, an attorney, a retired engineer, a marketing consultant, a caregiver, an insurance executive, a guy who tracks consumer trends and an activist who represents low-income tenants.

Entrepreneurs can opt for a provisional patent, which is an expedited process, which protects the patent for up to one year and costs a few hundred dollars. According to Moore, the process of granting patents has also been expedited, and Post Grant Review (PGR) has gone into effect, meaning a person who is not the patent owner may petition the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the validity of an issued patent. This process enables growing companies the ability to have their patents reviewed within 12 months, Moore said. What Entrepreneurs Need to Know About the America Invents Act and Patent Protection.

Under the new system that could start as soon as this July, licensing representatives will get a top 10 list of things to check which will show that if that provider does those things well, statistically speaking, they do everything else well allowing licensing representatives to spend more time on child care centers where young children could be in danger. Altogether, the state is responsible for overseeing more than 8,500 home day cares and more than 3,000 child care centers.#160; The report shows caseloads for licensing representatives have increased dramatically in recent years. Child care centers forced to wait months to renew licenses.Staff shortages at the Department of Children and Family Services are causing some child care centers to wait months before their licenses can be renewed causing problems for child care businesses and possibly putting childrens safety at risk. In the fourth quarter of the 2013 fiscal year, just 53 percent of child care providers were able to renew their licenses on time, according to a report the department submitted to the Illinois General Assembly in September 2013. She believes the new system will allow licensing representatives to give child care programs more attention a crucial step to improving quality. Though child care programs are allowed to continue operating with expired licenses, they are not able to access food subsidies for low-income children from the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, which requires that licenses be current. But Sessy Nyman, Vice President of Policy and Strategic Partnerships at the child-care advocacy group Illinois Action for Children, says that the shortage of licensing representatives could be putting children in danger. In Northern Illinois and in Cook County, there are currently an average of 104 home day cares and child care centers per licensing representative, up from around 90 in fiscal year 2010.

How many soldiers have you seen die on the side of a road in Afghanistan because our ever-so-accurate UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] were unable to detect an IED [improvised explosive device] that awaited their convoy? Whats more, the human beings flying and analyzing data from the UAVs are often traumatized by what they see.

When you are exposed to [watching people die] over and over again it becomes like a small video, embedded in your head, forever on repeat, causing psychological pain and suffering that many people will hopefully never experience. The UAVs in the Middle East are used as a weapon, not as protection, and as long as our public remains ignorant to this, this serious threat to the sanctity of human life at home and abroad will continue.

But the approaching 2016 presidential election might motivate lawmakers to come up with legislation Democrats and Republicans can agree on, says Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association. Republicans have opposed what theyve seen as an increase in regulations issued by the Obama administration that affect small business. HEALTH CARE AND REGULATIONS Republicans arent expected to try to repeal the health care law, but they are likely to try to change parts of the law small businesses oppose, NSBAs McCracken says. That would keep many individual business owners in a higher tax bracket than many corporations have. But there could be more support in Congress for a permanent extension of a deduction that allows small businesses to deduct up-front rather than depreciate the costs of some equipment. Some owners oppose a portion of the law that declares employees who work 30 or more hours a week full-time.

7830,"There is substantial legal grounds to treat downloads like licenses, rather than sales (especially in the iTunes model where the users right to make copies is limited). The ironic thing about the catalog artists, however, is that their contracts never contemplated digital distribution, and it wasnt until the late 70s that all media clauses started showing up in standard contracts. Of course, this was somewhat disingenuous on eBays part because Hotelling had made it clear with an amendment to the auction that the transfer would not take place through the Internet and electronically transferred items are sold all the time on eBay without incident. And they are known to cancel completely legitimate auctions at the whim of any member of their intellectual property group (read: record labels), so long as the member files an affidavit stating that the item in question is a violation of their copyright (even if its not). I also fully expect this not to trickle down to anyone else on the roster, and especially not to the catalog artists, who if the contract royalty rate is going to be applied, are going to get far less than 11 cents (the projected income from each download that is supposed to go to the artist). Nashville music attorney and artists advocate Fred Wilhelm offers the following: Interestingly, one of the excuses long given by the majors for foot dragging on licensing catalog to legitimate online services was the necessity of renegotiating with all the artists. In light of this excuse, I always found it odd that they never really seemed interested in actually negotiating, and havent with hundreds of artists, but have licensed their catalogs to iTunes anyway. This makes the dollar-a-pop charge far less attractive than the purchase of a CD for an equal amount (or less, as Universal has just announced price reductions on a grand scale), which is a good reason for iTunes to avoid using the term license in their publicity. As Hotelling puts it, he wanted to find out, Does the right of first sale still exist? The basic concept of the first sale doctrine is that when you buy something thats new (first sale) it becomes yours to sell for whatever price you please without interference from the original manufacturer.

ADVERTISEMENT According to the criminal complaint, Edmond is accused of repeatedly slapping her grandson on his hands. Hes also accused of using methamphetamine in the presence of his 11-month-old son, who allegedly had only been bathed four times in his life and later tested positive for meth, according to authorities. Under the conditions of her release, Edmond has been ordered to appear for a hearing in Magistrate Court at 8:30 a.m. March 20. However, a spokeswoman for the Doa Ana County Sheriffs Office said this week that there were no booking records for her. Court documents filed in Magistrate Court indicated that Edmond was released on unsecured appearance bond set at $10,000. She also allegedly slapped the child once on his face and shoved his head between crib bars, a third-degree felony. 2015 the Las Cruces Sun-News (Las Cruces, N.M.)

The company said it has picked out a West Des Moines headquarters, will likely open additional offices in the state and anticipates hiring some employees who provide clinical and provider services to work from home offices in rural areas. UnitedHealthcare projected that it would increase its existing 400-employee staff in Iowa by about 250 people. Continue Reading Below Details on those staffing plans were included in thousands of pages of documents released by the Iowa Department of Human Services, which announced the selection of the companies to manage the Medicaid program Monday following a competition involving 11 bidders. ""They are going to bring jobs,"" said Kelsey Clark, interim CEO of the Iowa Behavioral Health Association, whose members are concerned about changing to new billing policies and rules. The companies said their managers for the Iowa contracts and most of their employees would be located in Des Moines, but other parts of the state will benefit, too. ""We will be expanding our Iowa offices and employing more Iowans to support member call and claims functions in the state,"" the company's proposal wrote. The company said it plans to hire more than 400 full-time employees, with over half in Iowa. Some agents will work from home staffing a call center for Iowa claims. Advertisement WellCare, which is based in Tampa, said in its proposal that an estimated 90 employees would work at its Des Moines headquarters once that's established.

The LA Times wrote a story about the multi-billion dollar order that is flourishing in Mexico: The Legion of Christ As the Catholic Church is rocked by scandals about abusive priests and the failure of its hierarchy to confront them, Maciel in many ways embodies the insidiousness of the problem. Father Jonathan Morris Of Legion Of Christ, Created By Sex Criminal, Lectures Americans On Birth Control.Father Jonathan Morris, a Fox News analyst, was on Bill O'Reilly lecturing America about Obama's decision that Catholic institutions do not get to discriminate on birth control coverage for their employees due to their religious convictions. ""Dan Brown got the wrong group,"" said Genevieve Kineke, an orthodox Catholic who was a member of Regnum Christi, the legion's lay movement, from 1992 to 2000 and writes a blog about her experiences. Today the Legionaries, as they are known, operate in nearly 40 countries with 800 priests, 2,600 seminarians and a lay branch called Regnum Christi (""Christ's Kingdom"") that has more than 75,000 members.... read on The horror. Maciel was popular at the Vatican because the Legion was one of the fastest growing orders in the Catholic Church, able to produce wealth and recruit priests at a time of declining memberships and severe shortages in the clergy and because it espoused the conservative brand of Catholicism that recent popes have favored. In the above video, Bill O'Reilly shifts the discussion very quickly away from any mention of sexual abuse that was allowed to go on by the church across the world for decades and and how disgusting it is that men like Morris then try to lecture Americans on our system of government or the rights of women. I've written at length about the Legion Of Christ, a Catholic offshoot cult-like sect of the church and its sickening founder. They have also been the target",1,1

Online court records Friday did not list an attorney for el-Sherif, the labs radiation safety officer accused of illegally storing hazardous waste and obstruction by providing bogus Beta Chem tax returns meant to demonstrate his ability to cover the sites cleanup costs. The indictment alleges el-Sherif was licensed by Kansas to use Carbon-14 and solvents but eventually lost that permission after an inspection found extensive radioactive contamination in the lab. A Kansas chemist is accused in a federal indictment of illegally storing radioactive material that contaminated his now-closed lab in a suburban Kansas City industrial park, costing U.S. taxpayers $760,000 to clean up as a Superfund site.

6,"By this Obama meant Cantors insistent demand that the president accept a short-term hike in the debt ceiling, which would mean Congress would have to vote on yet another increase before next years election. The most hopeful sign is that some Republicans, at least, understand that their refusal to give an inch, even as Democrats show a willingness to compromise, means the GOP will be blamed if Social Security checks dont go out on time. Obamas frustration came as House Republicans refused to make a simple choice: Either they could give up their patently unfair and unreasonable demand that a deficit-reduction deal include absolutely no new revenue; or they could give up their equally absurd demand that any increase in the debt ceiling be accompanied, dollar for dollar, by budget cuts. McConnell has offered a plan that would essentially let Obama raise the debt ceiling himself taking the political heat with no mandatory budget cuts. Fairly soon after that date, Bernanke said, there would have to be significant cuts in Social Security, Medicare, military pay or some combination of those in order to avoid borrowing more money. The unamused president asked whether Ronald Reagan would have put up with such time-wasting nonsense, then uttered another memorable line: Ive reached my limit. The survey found that 48 percent of voters would blame the GOP in the event of default while 34 percent would hold the Obama administration responsible. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, a man not given to hyperbole, said Wednesday that the result would be a huge financial calamity and the wound, he noted, would be entirely self-inflicted. This must have occurred to Obama as he told the smirking, eye-rolling Cantor to bring it on but the president ended the meeting by telling congressional leaders hed see them again Thursday. Even 20 percent of Republicans would point the finger at their own party. Those words suggest President Obama has had it up to here with the preening and posturing of Republican negotiators who wont negotiate. All they have to do is approve a big enough increase in the debt ceiling to avoid having this same fight every few months.",1,1

Obamacare posts huge numbers in California — but why isn’t it working elsewhere?.We recently reported that the Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare has just posted some stunning successes in California, where more than two-thirds of those who did not have insurance before the passage of the ACA now have it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey that was released this week. An editorial from the Chicago Sun-Times#160;lays the blame at the doorstep of conservatives: specifically, those in charge of states that refuse to work with the ACA and instead have attempted to stand in the way of it, or even stop it altogether. The Kaiser Family Foundation said that California stands out as a laboratory for the three-year-old law because it has the largest number of uninsured, it has a great deal of racial and ethnic diversity, and the state government has fully cooperated with rolling out ACA. But what the recent numbers in California show, the editorial claims, is that Obamacare will work when states cooperate with it. It certainly gives ammo to those on the left who support Obamacare that the law can work if conservatives give it a chance. However, that seems entirely unlikely to happen, and the law may not last at all if Republicans get their way. But in other states, Obamacare is landing with a flop. Why?",0,2

The improvised artillery piece consisted of a huge steel pipe, taking up most of the space in the back of a minivan, and an air compressor used to propel bundles of drugs across the border into US territory. Other intricate methods employed by smugglers over the years have included secret tunnels, light aircraft and medieval-style catapults, not to mention stuffing drugs in innocuous-looking things like watermelons, wheelchairs and even breast implants. Read more Some ammunition for the gun was captured as well, amounting to over 825 kilograms (1,800 pounds) of marijuana, as well as about 2,000 bullets for more conventional firearms of various caliber. In September 2016, another air cannon, with a 10-foot (about 3-meter) pipe mounted on a van with a specially-cut hole in its roof was seized in Agua Prieta. Mexican smugglers have resorted to a number of inventive ways to deliver illegal drug packages into the US. The Mexican Attorney Generals Office Sonora branch seized the ingenuous contraption in a joint operation with military personnel near the town of Agua Prieta, right across the border from Douglas, Arizona. None of the criminals that operated the drug-launching machine were arrested in the operation.

10937,"Trump backed Conway both publicly and privately Thursday after House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, criticized her for promoting Ivanka Trumps fashion line during a television appearance and urged the Office of Government Ethics to review the matter. The president appeared to take issue with his own press secretarys depiction, telling staff that he believed it was unfair to Conway and made it sound like she was in trouble, according to a person with direct knowledge of his comments. A White House spokeswoman said that while Trump didnt see Conways television comments urging people to buy Ivanka Trumps products, he believed she was merely sticking up for his daughter after Nordstrom dropped her brand. The Trump associate and the person with knowledge of the presidents comments about Conway insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss internal matters. For whatever reason, the White House staff evidently believes that they are protected from the law the same way the president and vice president are, said Stuart Gilman, a former special assistant to the director of OGE. One Trump associate said Conways standing with some senior staff had been hurt by her recent missteps, though the person noted that her relationship with the president remained strong. ADVERTISEMENT But because Conway reports only to Trump, it would be up to him to punish her for any ethics infraction and that seems unlikely. The news network was angered last weekend when Vice President Mike Pence made the rounds of Sunday talk shows and pointedly left out Jake Tappers CNN show. Conways sales pitch for Ivanka Trump was particularly notable in that it sparked a rebuke from Chaffetz, a Republican who until now has not questioned the young administration on ethical matters.

2774,"While the gunman took his own life and authorities are not contemplating any prosecutions, the lead investigator, States Attorney Stephen Sedensky III, has gone to court to fight the release of 911 tapes, consulted privately with victims families on what might be included in the report and resisted calls from Connecticuts governor to divulge more information sooner. ADVERTISEMENT Dan Klau, a Hartford attorney who specializes in First Amendment law, said the decision to release a summary report before the full evidence file is a reversal of standard practice and one of the most unusual elements of an investigation marked by secrecy. The decision to continue withholding the bulk of the evidence is stirring new criticism of the secrecy that has surrounded the probe since a gunman killed 20 children and six educators inside the school on Dec. 14. In defense of their handling of records, investigators have cited the scale of the criminal investigation perhaps the most extensive in Connecticuts history and consideration for the victims families, some of whom have lobbied for tighter restrictions on public information and complained of being harassed by conspiracy theorists. Mark Dupuis, a spokesman for Sedensky, said the summary released today will not include the state police report, which is expected to total thousands of pages. The information that authorities have not revealed includes the timeline of the police response to the shooting, any mental health records for Lanza and whether investigators found any clues to a possible motive for the rampage. What I found troubling about the approach of the states attorney is that from my perspective, he seems to have forgotten his job is to represent the state of Connecticut, Klau said. So far, investigators have released little more than search warrants, which detailed an arsenal of weapons found inside the Lanza home. The withholding of 911 recordings, which are routinely released in other cases, has been the subject of a legal battle between The Associated Press and Sedensky before the states Freedom of Information Commission, which ruled in favor of the AP, and now Connecticuts court system. His conduct in many instances has seemed more akin to an attorney in private practice representing Sandy Hook families. A hearing",0,0

In one paragraph, Obama did what many of the dispirited in his party have long been urging him to do: He linked the economic mess to past Republican policies much as Ronald Reagan blamed the economic downturn of the early 1980s on Democrats and liberals and turned the tables on bipartisanship by asserting that it is Republicans who are blocking concord. Obama said that some of the rhetoric thats coming out of the other side of the aisle suggested that Republicans so far, at least, dont seem to acknowledge that were going to have to make some tough decisions and reform the system. He used his praise of Boxer she wants to cooperate with folks on the other side of the aisle where she can, but shes willing to fight where she has to as a pivot to what he hopes will be a central theme of this years national election campaign. But Obama has now joined the battle with a strategy to transform the election from a referendum on his own party into a contest with a Republican Party the public doesnt much like, either. And for the first time in Obamas presidency, Republicans are uncertain as to whether resolute opposition to a Democratic idea is in their political interest. Democrats clearly see financial reform as a winner either way. Suddenly, its Democrats and, in particular, the often conflict-averse Obama who are relishing a fight. This raises what may be the essential question for the campaign: Can Democrats finally put the Republicans on the defensive? Now she is seen as sufficiently vulnerable that Obama will come to the state for another fundraiser for her next month. If health care legislation had to fight uphill against a public mood that is skeptical of governments capacities, the financial reform bill Democrats are pushing has the advantage of flowing with a public view devoutly critical of Wall Street, bankers and all their works.

In other words, if Ruth Bader Ginsburg has her way, sexual abuse of children 12-years or older would not be a crime, nor would child sex trafficking. Pedophilia is legally defined as sexual child abuse, i.e., any sexual activity with a minor below the age of consent, which includes fondling a childs genitals, intercourse, incest, rape, sodomy, exhibitionism, and commercial exploitation of children through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials. Sexual intercourse with a person under the age of consent may lead to criminal charges of statutory rape or sexual assault. That is exactly what Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a Clinton appointee and daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, recommends in a co-authored book that led to sweeping changes made by the federal government in the name of sex equality. The Mann Act is a federal law passed in 1910 which makes it a felony to engage in interstate or foreign commerce transport of any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.

496,"The level of white fear expressed here by Atlanta attorney Sam Dickson is high, and we can only assume he is not alone in seeing Mexican immigrants and their Mexican American children as a threat to the kind of Southern society Strom Thurmond and Trent Lott continue to promote. Since most of the new Latinos in the South are first-generation immigrants they have little if any knowledge of the Chicano struggles for equal rights and the history of anti-Mexican racism in the Southwest. The media coverage of the Lott affair reminds of us of two important facts: 1) the discussion of race in the U.S. is still firmly grounded in a narrow and antiquated black/white reality and 2) despite the Republican Partys attempt to distance itself from Lott and his ilk it continues to be a party whose electoral victories are totally dependent on the old Confederate core. The civil rights voting record of new Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R. Tenn.) on issues affecting Latinos, Blacks, women, and gays is just as bad if not worse than that of Trent Lott. What all this will mean for the majority of Latinos (leaving aside the extreme pro-Bush elements in Floridas Cuban community) remains to be seen. Will discrimination in education and housing and economic inequality in general eventually produce a new Chicano Movement that will rise up this time not in the Southwest but deep in the heart of Dixie? Over the last decade, Mexican and Latino immigrants have moved in large numbers into the old Confederacy. As they enter a culture based on black/white relations, these workers are unaware of regional histories, past labor struggles, and the persistence of long-standing Southern values. Lott was a key player and often boasted that Republican Party programs were reviving the spirit of Jefferson Davis, the former president of the Confederacy. It is a little known fact that during the Reagan-Bush retrenchment a Neo-Confederate movement emerged across the Deep South.

Not long after he began his Trump investigation, Steele discussed his work with a senior FBI agent who traveled to England to meet with him, according to sources familiar with the matter and emails seen by Reuters. Two officials familiar with the investigations said that both Muellers team and the Senate Intelligence Committee are seeking any evidence that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or others who had financial dealings with Russia might have helped Kremlin intelligence agencies target email hacking and social media postings undermining Trumps election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Wednesday, the Senate panels chairman Richard Burr told reporters that the issue of whether Trumps campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question. Three sources with knowledge of Muellers probe said his investigators have assumed control of multiple inquiries into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump, a Republican. Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January.

California-based Zipline, the company that generated buzz with its plans to transport medical supplies to remote communities using drones, has officially launched its delivery service in the small African nation. Its the first implementation of a concept that could soon make its way to the United States, where Zipline intends to deliver medical necessities to isolated areas, such as reservations and islands.

Zipline isnt the only organization that sees the potential for drones to address the persistent humanitarian and health-care needs in some African countries. Doctors in remote clinics use a mobile phone to contact the Zipline distribution center and request blood of a certain type.

The centers staff then loads the blood into an aerial drone that gets flung into the air and flies directly to the medical facility. Commercial drone delivery has yet to be fully realized in the United States, in part because of strict regulations over who can fly drones, where they can fly and for what purpose.

2560,"One of the films most heart-rending moments comes as Marie returns from the nearest thing she has ever had to a genuinely romantic day or two alone with Chriswhom she knows has casually cheated on herand announces happily to Isa that she might be going to get a job as a waitress in Chriss fathers barand may be, eventually, a barmaid. But during her brief period of employment she meets another girl of about her own age called Marie (Natacha Regnier) who is much less warm and friendly than Isa and in fact rather stand-offish to her, but who is prevailed upon to allow Isa, who has no place to go, to come home with her. Once again expectations are defeated: Charly for all his rough looks is a decent, wise, even a humble man who knows that someone like Marie is unlikely to retain her interest in him for long. The two of them fight about this and about Isas inability to understand Maries indifference to Sandrine: Youre living in her home and you dont even know who she is! Gradually, the two become friends, though rather because Isas charm and warm-heartedness are irresistible, even to someone as self-absorbed as we soon learn Marie to be, than because the latter has any wish for friendship. Zonca is playing with our expectations partly because he knows that we know how easily such images can be made to suggest another heaping helping of the kind of nihilism which is in the prevailing spirit of French cinema. Here and in what followsscenes of Isa sleeping rough and making little cards out of colored paper and pictures cut from magazines that she then tries to sell on the streetwe are encouraged to jump to exactly the wrong conclusions: that she has been seduced and abandoned, for instance, or that she is going to be a political statement first and a character only (if at all) second. They both are soon to have to leave in any case, as the apartment is being sold by a brother of the dead woman who also doesnt much care about Sandrine. Part of the fascination of the film comes from watching the sexual relationship between these two very similar people, each of whom hungers almost shockingly for the other",0,4
4918,"Though McCain issued a statement the next week calling on Congress to make sacrifices in order to fund recovery efforts, he was quoted in The New Leader on September 1 cautioning against over-spending in support of Katrinas victims. McCain may talk sympathetically about New Orleans recovery this week, but the record shows that when it mattered most, McCain failed to act. Three days later, with the levees already breached and New Orleans filling with water, McCains office released a three-sentence statement urging Americans to support the victims of the hurricane. Shortly after the disaster in New Orleans, McCain did introduce a bill that sought to improve communications mechanisms for first-responders and authorities. John McCains Time for Action tour arrived in New Orleans Thursday, where McCain toured the hurricane-damaged 9th Ward and criticized both the Bush Administration and Congress for its handling of the disaster. Lamenting the pace of recovery, McCain said, I want to assure you it will never happen again in this country. Forty Senators and 100 members of Congress visited New Orleans before he did; he finally got there in March 2006. One day later, when Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, McCain was on a tarmac at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, greeting President Bush with a cake in celebration of McCains 69th birthday. He voted against allowing up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits to people affected by the hurricane, and in 2006 voted against appropriating $109 billion in supplemental emergency funding, including $28 billion for hurricane relief. His passion for fiscal conservatism blinded him to a city and a region in need, and his Time for Action is simply too late. But McCains record on Hurricane Katrina suggests that he was part of the problem, not the solution. The bill failed to go anywhere, and McCain later voted against other bills that had similar provisions.",1,1

Here in Massachusetts, 10,000 assault weapons were sold just in the last year each one nearly identical to the rifle used to gun down 49 innocent people in Orlando. Democrats and the press didn't even accurately identify the rifle in question until days after, which is important to get correct when your first response is to call for a specific gun ban. So now everything is illegal except handguns, which account for double what rifles such as this do respective to gun homicide, but it's bad optics for anti-gun groups to target hand guns, thus the focus shift in the 90s. Murder by AR-15 or semiautomatic riflelet's be adults and use accurate terms here, not assault weapons as applied to civilian use firearmsaccounts for barely a fraction of gun homicides. The impotent assault weapons ban in the 90s had zero effect on gun homicides as it only regulated cosmetic features (any two from a list of five, including a detachable magazine) which Democrats determined made rifles shootier. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. It is designed to use the same magazines as a number of.308-caliber rifles absurdly defined as assault weapons by name and Healeys capricious duplicate definition under Massachusetts law. Healey shows her hand and the hands of anti-gun advocates everywhere: It isn't about banning accessories, it's always and only ever been about banning the entire gun. In fact, gun homicides have decreased by 40% and Americans are safer now than they've been at any point in my lifetime (this as the number of gun owners has dramatically expanded), but fewer than 12% are aware",1,3

5913,"ADVERTISEMENT Parties generally have 90 days to appeal to the Supreme Court, but if the administration waits until late August to ask the court to step in, the justices probably would not vote on whether to hear the case until October and arguments probably wouldnt take place until February 2018 at the earliest. Administration lawyers could instead seek the justices approval to put the travel policy in place on an emergency basis, even as the court weighs what to do with the larger dispute. If at least five justices vote to let the travel ban take effect, theres a good chance they also would uphold the policy later on. Citing the presidents duty to protect the country from terrorism, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Thursday that the Justice Department will ask the high court to review the case, although he offered no timetable. The justices almost always have the final say when a lower court strikes down a federal law or presidential action. The case pits the presidents significant authority over immigration against what the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit said was a policy that purported to be about national security but was intended to target Muslims. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th Circuit is the first appeals court to rule on the revised ban. Trumps first travel ban issued Jan. 27 was aimed at seven countries and triggered chaos and protests across the U.S. as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. Still, he said, Supreme Court justices dont always vote in ideological lockstep. Trump tweaked the order after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit refused to reinstate the ban. The court ruled 10-3 that the ban likely violates the Constitution and upheld a lower court ruling blocking the Republican administration from enforcing the travel ban unveiled in March, a revised version of the policy first issued in January. Trumps administration argued the 4th Circuit should not look beyond the text of the executive order, which doesnt mention religion.",0,0

In addition, a number of conservative bloggers have been targeted with a dangerous and illegal tactic that's become known as SWAT-ing - (making false 911 calls sending police to the homes of bloggers, claiming a crime has occurred.) The ACLJ has a long history of successfully defending free speech, and we look forward to defeating this latest attempt to threaten and intimidate conservatives into silence. Ali Akbar is president of the National Bloggers Club, a coalition of 300 conservative bloggers who reach millions of readers, has been targeted by these vicious attacks on himself and, even worse, his family. As Akbar told the ACLJ, ""I'm grateful for the support of the ACLJ, and I'm confident we'll defeat any and all legal challenges to our fundamental right to free speech.

Conservative writers are now facing threats against themselves, their families, and their livelihoods merely because they've aggressively investigated the history and funding of radical liberals. He has also received formal notification that he may soon be sued for publishing truthful information about radical liberals and their wealthy donors.

If your circumstances have improved since your friend let you use his card -- for example, if you're back on your feet with a new job -- paying money back can help you feel good about helping the family and honoring the memory of the friend you lost. The family may not like the fact that you took cash in that manner, but they can't do much about it. If the deceased person has dependents, or if you know that the family members had to dig into their own pockets to pay final expenses, you may especially favor this option. For example, if you were sick or unemployed when your friend offered to let you take cash advances, the family is more likely to be understanding than if they are left to imagine you took the money to go out on the town. Assuming he was in sound mind, as you say, they can't get the money back from you, any more than they can undo other purchases and gifts the deceased person made before he died. You may choose to repay part or all of the cash advances of your own free will. In ordinary circumstances, you cannot be forced to reimburse the estate or other family members who paid off the card. This included the right to take cash advances on the account. As an authorized user, you would not be responsible for the balance on the accounts, even if they were not paid off.

Since 2001 the US Governments Interagency Fire Center (the forest Service is one of the participating agencies) has collected and displayed on its web site wildland fire statistics for regions and the nation as a whole. The decision flew in the face of Forest Service and Bush Administration assurances that state governments would have a voice in deciding the fate of national forest roadless lands. California officials had stated quite clearly that they wanted the remaining roadless lands in the Golden State to stay that wayroadless. You can view the data at Clearly in Southern California human caused fires are a much bigger problem than lightning fires. For generations employees of the United States Forest Service clad in their crisp green uniforms and with Smokey the Bear always nearby were among the most trusted government officials in the world. According to Stewart the roads are needed to fight fires which, she asserted, have been a perennial problem in the wilderness. More roads in Southern Californias roadless lands will undoubtedly result in more human-caused fires and more risk to human life and property. Now, if Americans think about US Forest Service rangers at all, they are likely to liken them to snake oil salesmen.

Smartphone apps are the latest tools to emerge from the intersection of health care and Silicon Valley, where tech companies are also working on new ways of bringing patients and doctors together online, applying massive computing power to analyze DNA and even developing ingestible ""smart"" pills for detecting cancer. But if smartphones hold great promise for medical research, experts say there are issues to consider when turning vast numbers of people into walking test subjects.

New interim Albuquerque Police Chief Allen Banks said he plans to jump full force into his new job, and when the time comes, decide then if he will pursue permanently the job of being the citys top cop. It wasnt anything specific really that he said, but it was just that you could see that he had this burning desire to serve, and his passion showed when he came out to show us right from wrong, Banks said. Of course, that didnt happen, but the tragedy of drugs, and seeing friends hurt and killed in my neighborhood, made my own passion to become an officer bigger and bigger. Banks wouldnt say when hed decide about seeking the job on a permanent basis. Its a pretty big distinction, but its a testimony to anybody that it doesnt matter about color or where youre from, it only matters how much work you put in to get to where you want to be, he said. Banks said he was moved to become a police officer in grade school when officer Phil Chacon came and visited his classroom.

Everyone with this department wants to do a great job, and were all going to press forward to try and continue to make this community proud of us, he said.

Las Vegas senator wants ignition device on cars of all arrested for DUI.CARSON CITY Law enforcement and drunken driving victims voiced unified support Friday for a bill requiring first-time DUI offenders to install ignition interlock systems on their vehicles. Victoria Hauan with the Nevada Office of Traffic Safety said 50 percent to 75 percent of those arrested for drunken driving continue to drive on a suspended license. Backers of Senate Bill 259, introduced by Sen. Mark Manendo, said the bill would save lives by preventing alleged DUI offenders from continuing to drive on suspended licenses while they await a court date. Based on research and data, it shows a significant reduction in alcohol-related crashes and recidivism in the states that have passed first-time ignition interlock laws, Mandeno, D-Las Vegas, said at press conference outside the legislative building. HOW THEY WORK Aaron Wade, with the Coalition of Ignition Interlock Manufacturers, said five companies in Nevada that provide ignition interlock devices. Twenty-eight states plus the District of Columbia mandate ignition interlocks for all DUI offenders. Under existing law, a person arrested for drunken driving loses their license for 90 days. In 2015, there were 8,813 DUI arrests in Nevada, and 80 percent of those were first-time offenders. Wade said the device sends out a warning every 20-30 minutes, alterting drivers they will need to pull over and re-take the test. She said research has shown 39 percent of those whove been required to use an ignition lock are less likely to re-offend. If even a small amount of alcohol is detected, the vehicle wont start.",0,4

Ackerman, who would like to see the material transferred to the General Archive of the Nation located in a former Mexico City prison, the Lecumberri Black Palace, considers that the negatives of the IFE, the TRIFE, and their colleagues on the Supreme Court to grant FOI access to the ballots, makes Mexicos vaunted Freedom of Information Act a hollow document. Under the threat of a new round of angry demonstrations by AMLOs supporters and with one eye on the approaching first anniversary of this still-disputed election, the IFE General Council voted once again May 30th to postpone destruction until all appeals are exhausted Rodriguezs latest appeal to the Supreme Court remains pending. Proceso and other plaintiffs have good reason to be suspicious about what is inside the ballot boxes thousands of which were illegally opened by IFE operators in the weeks following the balloting despite judicial constraints on violating the seals of the urnas. In 31% of the recounted precincts, less votes were cast than the number of ballots allocated to the polling place yet no blank ballots were returned to the IFE as the law mandates, suggesting vote stealing by Calderon partisans. Since the election, Lopez Obrador, who insists he won and says he is the legitimate president of Mexico, has demanded that the 130,000 ballot boxes (urnas) be opened and the ballots counted out one by one.

As criticism of the ban went viral on social media late Thursday, a Taliban spokesman sent a message to a journalist, dryly noting: ""In case WhatsApp doesn't work, this is my Viber number."" While state-owned Salaam Telecom blocked the apps, three private service providers -- MTN, Etisalat and Roshan -- refused, with an official at one saying compliance with the order would lead to more censorship. One official for the National Directorate of Security, the country's intelligence agency, said the directive came from his agency because militant groups were using the apps. The statement didn't elaborate on the nature of the complaints, where they originated or how the government could improve the apps' quality, but it added, ""The government is fully committed to freedom of speech and recognizes it as a civil right."" WhatsApp is reporting normal messaging rates but said users may have faced access issues due to a global outage around 1 a.m. Pacific time Friday. Others questioned the government's motives, especially suggestions that the ban was aimed at curbing use of the apps by the Taliban or one of the many other insurgent groups in the country.

But as much as these often distressing incidents play on the minds of swimmers and surfers, the risk sharks pose to Americans taking to the water remains statistically low, according to Cindy Claus, director of Jenkinsons Aquarium, in Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. ""When you look at the end of the year how many people have been attacked by sharks, compared with people killed by bee stings and people who are hit by lightning, there is more chance of these things happening but we dont tend to worry about them as much,"" she said. Great whites are not unheard of, but Claus said that the predators made famous in the ""Jaws"" movies, ""are more elusive and perhaps not as common in the places where people are likely to be swimming."" There were 52 shark attacks recorded in the U.S. last year, none of which was fatal, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida. ""When you get up to Massachusetts, the water is a lot colder and youre not likely to get as many swimmers up there,"" Claus said. The two attacks in North Carolina on Sunday in which a 16-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl lost their left arms and suffered other serious injuries were ""a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time,"" Claus told NBC News on Tuesday. Claus was also quick to point out the statistical rarity of shark attacks compared with other dangers. According to Claus, sharks are most commonly found from Florida, through the Carolinas, Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey and Long Island. There are around 50 to 60 different types of shark that can be found off the Carolinas coast alone, she added, but the most common types found in U.S waters were the tiger shark, white shark, bull shark and mako shark.

The suspect's 26-year-old sister, reached in the southern Norwegian town of Larvik, said his family was unaware of any role he may have played in the four-day siege that killed at least 67 people. A former high school classmate of Dhuhulow's said it was hard to believe that the teen she once knew could have carried out such an attack. But it's difficult to see, said the woman, who didn't want her name used because she was uncomfortable being associated with a terror investigation. Johansen Oduor, the chief Kenyan government pathologist, said he didn't know if the remains were those of two bodies or three because the remains were sealed and he hadn't seen them yet. Somali authorities may have had Dhuhulow in their grasp earlier this year, when a man with the same name was arrested in Mogadishu in connection with the murder of a Somali journalist. A police official said three suspects are in custody, though none directly took part in the attack.

How could Democrats possibly oppose putting that delay into statute, which is the only real way to relieve employers of their obligations? The administration is trying to portray the change as a small adjustment in an otherwise inevitable implementation of the law when what was announced completely discredits what the administration had been telling everyone for months. This latest announcement from the administration, along with the delay of the employer mandate, makes it clear that now is the moment for the House GOP to begin fighting back. The administrations solution to the problem is to pretend that the income and employment verification system wasnt really needed at all in 2014, and that applicant attestation will suffice. More fundamentally, why should the exchanges be allowed to begin signing up people for coverage in 2014 when systems are not in place to protect taxpayers from waste and fraud? The administration has had three and a half years to build the data hub that was supposed to be the repository of real-time income information that the state exchanges would tap to administer benefits. On both counts, the state exchanges can simply accept whatever is claimed by the applicants as accurate, and then pay out subsidies accordingly. The real story here is that the exchange roll-out has reached the point of administrative collapse, and the administration is doing everything it can to hide that fact. At a minimum, the utter collapse of the implementation process cries out for a year-long delay, before real and perhaps irreversible damage is done. ), the verification system they were telling everyone for months would be ready on time is now, well, not ready on time, with no prospect that it ever will be operational.",0,4

4564,"Microsoft and NVIDIA are hoping that by making it simpler and easier to configure a data center around a standard design, the market for cloud computing can accelerate even faster. But there are also many start-up businesses and organizations that would like access to a data center for the application of deep learning with GPUs, except it's too costly. NVIDIA's (NASDAQ: NVDA) data center segment grew 145% in fiscal 2017 to $830 million as growth in applications of deep learning and cloud computing fueled demand for NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs). Major technology companies like Baidu, Alphabet, and Facebookwere among the first to use GPUs for deep learning. So far, partnerships with many of the largest technology companies in the world are positioning NVIDIA as the GPU provider of choice for cloud computing. The HGX-1 is part of Microsoft's Project Olympus initiative to create a standardized open-source hardware architecture for cloud providers to build data centers around. These companies are providing very fast GPU-powered cloud computing for a much lower cost than the large capital investment it would otherwise require. Unlike the central processing units (CPUs) used to open and close applications on PCs, the GPU can handle multiple parallel processing tasks simultaneously, allowing large amounts of data to be processed much faster. NVIDIA and Microsoft are labeling the HGX-1 as the new architectural standard for cloud computing. What is known as GPU-accelerated computing has brought to reality the idea of deep learning -- an advanced form of artificial intelligence. The HGX-1 uses NVIDIA's NVLink technology to allow companies to customize the right ratio of CPUs and GPUs for a specific task. If the same thing happens with respect to the HGX-1 for cloud computing, it could further accelerate demand for AI cloud computing, with NVIDIA holding a position as the dominant chip provider.",1,3

12537,"Some Senate Republicans will no doubt claim that the Affordable Care Act cant be sustained in its present form because private insurers are beginning to bail out of it. Which means that unless Senate Republicans repudiate their own Congressional Budget Office (whose director they appointed), theyll have to either vote to take away healthcare for 23 million people, or come up with their own plan. But if they try to come up with their own plan, theyll soon discover theres no way to insure those 23 million without (1) mandating that healthy people buy insurance, so that sick people with pre-existing conditions can afford it; and (2) keeping the existing taxes on rich people so that poor people can afford to buy health insurance. This is surely better than repealing the Affordable Care Act and taking away health insurance coverage for 23 million people. The Congressional Budget Office has made it crystal clear that the House version of Trumpcare will cause 23 million Americans to lose their health coverage. But Senate Republicans wont get near a single payer. They may wrap it up in different garb and call it by a different name, but in the end the logic is unavoidable: Theyll have to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. In 2010 Congress established risk corridors to protect insurers against uncertainties in setting the level of insurance premiums when they didnt know who would sign up. The only alternative is a single-payer plan Medicare for all that would provide universal coverage more cheaply than our present system, as embraced by most other advanced nations. And the Trump Administration has done everything possible to generate even more uncertainty among insurers. Thats an awkward argument for Republicans to make because Republicans themselves have been responsible for this problem. In other words, theyll be back to the Affordable Care Act.",1,1

Whether Sinn Fin can become the party vehicle for fighting austerity depends on whether it can confront its past no easy task in a country with a much-hated border that also divides the party. However, it was only after the mass protests against water charges as well as an October parliamentary by-election in which the party lost a seat to the further left Anti-Austerity Alliance candidate that the Sinn Fin#160;came out against the fees. This is the first of two major problems faced by Sinn Fin, if it hopes to radically shift Irish politics toward the left. The impetus for the biggest protest movement in a generation and perhaps since independence from Britain is the Irish governments plan to institute a new tax on water, ranging from 176 to as much as 500, depending on the size of the household. While limited to#160;two center-right parties in government, the idea of an Irish workers republic, from the plough to the stars, is an old one. In the days leading up to Christmas, the two parties (both governing a statelet of the United Kingdom) agreed to a local if softened version of David Camerons austerity measures. A Syriza victory in Greece would be a boon for the emerging Irish anti-austerity left in general, and may bolster forces to the left of#160;Sinn Fin.

9098,"U.S. travel restrictions jeopardize rare exchanges with North Koreans.By Dan Levine SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) When more than a dozen North Korean economic officials visited California and New York in 2011, U.S. organizers hoped the tour would give the delegation ideas for market reforms and business innovations. HUMANITARIAN PURPOSES North Koreans wishing to visit the United States must first obtain permission from their own government, then apply for a visa in person at a U.S. embassy, typically in Beijing, said Robert King, former U.S. special envoy for North Korea human rights issues. While the travel restrictions are unlikely to have a broad impact the number of non-diplomatic travelers from North Korea per year rarely tops 50, according to U.S. State Department data human rights activists worry it has severed one of the few human bonds between the isolated country and the West. The main point in inviting these people here is to give them exposure to the U.S., and see if one can open the door a bit, said Roberta Cohen, co-chair emeritus for the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. In 2011, four North Korean scientists traveled to Missouri to collaborate with their U.S. counterparts on soil quality testing methods, he said, in order to boost food production. When North Koreans arrive in the United States they never go anywhere alone, King said, and are chaperoned by North Korean government minders. Those exchanges are now in jeopardy after President Donald Trump included North Korea in a group of nations that will face travel restrictions to the United States because they do not share enough information about visa applicants. A State Department official said the restrictions were necessary because North Korea does not cooperate with the United States government in any respect and fails to satisfy all information-sharing requirements on visa applicants. North Korea was planning earlier this year to take part in the 2017 world championships in Anaheim, California, in November, Andrews said.

A number of people in positions of power wanted to know just what ""experts"" people like Breuer had consulted with before deciding not to press charges in certain cases. Yet this is exactly what happened: The court decided that the evidence that Winston was wrongfully terminated was insufficient, and then from there determined that the ""legal error"" in the original Winston suit against Bank of America and Countrywide was that the judge in the case failed to throw out the jury's verdict: In short, having scoured the record for evidence supporting the jury's verdict on the issue of causation, we have found none. He sued, and in one of the few positive outcomes for any white-collar whistleblower anywhere in the post-financial-crisis universe, won a $3.8 million wrongful termination",1,1

Thats why New York is also investing in a large scale project, proposed by a Dutch firm, called the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project it calls for a system of hills along the coastline, forming a U around Manhattan. Every public agency, every private development organization, every real estate organization has changed the way they manage buildings, design buildings, build buildings, to take into account the effects of the storm and the fact that it could happen again. New York did make sure everything that got built after Sandy was better prepared for a flood. GET THE FULL SERIES You have these countries like Netherlands that have the ability to do whatever they want at the waterfront, Porto said. Insurance rates would skyrocket, though, if a storm like Sandy ever hit Boston to reflect the cost of rebuilding. Thats because European cities vulnerable to flooding have learned to live with it, putting parks next to coastlines that sometimes overflow. But its tough for American cities to take the same steps, in part because money for improvements only flows into a community after a disaster. I think because theres so much risk in cities, and its so hard to adapt, the idea is you gotta work in layers, he said. You can go to the coffee shops in the seaport and you can see the line the Sandy line over my head, more than six feet high, said Michael Porto, director of outreach and planning for the nonprofit Waterfront Alliance, walking past construction crews rebuilding tourist shops. Many are experiencing building booms along coastlines, without the same stringent flood-proofing regulations in place as New York. In these cities where a catastrophe is still only a threat, people build next to shorelines without paying for the increased risk of flooding due to climate change.",0,2
12054,"I dont know, and neither can anybody else, if Ashcrofts Justice Department after one of their daily prayer breakfasts, or an awakened majority of congresspersons, or perhaps even a court presented with a petition seeking an investigation, can be persuaded to actually order appointment of a special counsel to investigate war crimes at the top of the US Government. Condemning the war crimes of Bush, Cheney amp; Co., as described above, even without appointment of a special counsel, could help deprive the Bush pirates of what tiny remnants of credibility they may still possess in some isolated pockets of US public opinion, which they desperately need to continue their policies. Carping in the US corporate media about the supposed lack of an exit strategy reflects the spinelessness of those who still seem unwilling to hold the Bush Administrations feet to the fire of accountability, for what has come to be seen in many quarters as one of the most remarkable, appalling and massive failures of judgment and power in history. In light of the utter fiasco in Iraq, the incredible pain and suffering of the Bush/Cheney administrations many victims, and the resultant devastating damage to US credibility virtually everywhere, it may well be that nothing less will do the trick. Only 2 days later, on May 20, the ever-responsive Peoples champion on Capitol Hill Rep. Conyers of Detroit, along with all the other Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Ashcroft, requesting that he appoint a special counsel to investigate whether high ranking officials within the Bush Administration violated the War Crimes Act, 18 USC 2441, by approving the use of torture techniques banned by international law. Turning up the heat on those ultimately responsible for the Iraq disaster by calling for them to be prosecuted for war crimes could be one of the most promising ways to keep this mess from getting even worse.

Even during the Great Depression, when it faced shrinking profit margins, industrial giant General Electric limited its wage cuts to 10%, according to Chris Townsend, political director of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine workers, who recently perused his union's extensive files. Two-tier and multi-tier wage structureswhich freeze the pay and benefits of long-term union members at current levels while slashing starting wages by 40% or more for new workershave begun to proliferate in the face of labor's weakened bargaining power. A number of indicators document that the trend toward wage-cuttingspotlighted by New York Times economics reporter Louis Uchitelle in early 2009 when the reverberations of the Wall Street meltdown were still being feltis, if anything, gaining momentum even as major corporations have fully recovered. Absent a revitalized upsurge from labor and its allies like the Occupy movement that places inequality squarely at the center of the presidential campaign in 2012, we can expect even further acceleration of wage-slashing from corporate America. Despite massive profit gains, however, corporations are adding more jobs overseas than they are in the United States and paying one of the lowest effective tax rates in the developed world. In some states, like Wisconsin, there have been employment gains in traditionally high-wage industries like manufacturing, but these industries have also witnessed wage drops, as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.

3150,"But some argue that other old farming practices, such as fertilizing with manure and raising livestock on grass, are just the thing needed to store carbon dioxide in the soil and combat global warming. Building humus is a great way to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in the soil for potentially long periods of time, which means that old practices can address new challenges, such as climate change. Thats why a new generation of agrarians is returning to the roots of agriculture for a different approach that includes large helpings of science and social responsibility as well. As gardeners know, creating the dark, rich soil called humus is critical to plant vigor, mineral uptake and smart water use. He measures the carbon content of the soil through sophisticated technology, aiming to raise the content as high as possible, and he also co-founded Farm Hack, an open-source virtual caf for young and beginning farmers. It states boldly that we could sequester more than 100 percent of current annual CO2 emissions by switching to soil-creating, inexpensive and effective organic agricultural methods.

Like Dorn, many young people in agriculture today are looking to the past and what they have discovered is that natures model works best. Last spring, the Rodale Institute, a research and education nonprofit, released a white paper entitled Regenerative Organic Agriculture and Climate Change: A Down-to-Earth Solution to Global Warming.

11399,"In its reporting on a dubious lawsuit alleging Iranian meta-involvement in 9/11, the New York Times badly misunderstood the case and maintained for more than three years, in the paper of record, that the government of Iran sponsored the September 11, 2001, attacks. This article, published in the first year of Obamas second term, finally got corrected this week ( 9/26/13, correction updated 7/5/17), with basically the same correction that ran on last weeks story: Correction: July 5, 2017 An article on Sept. 25, 2013, about the federal governments efforts to seize a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper it says is controlled by Iran overstated Irans responsibility for the September 11 attacks. The belated correction, issued late Wednesday night on two widely spaced articles on the topic, unceremoniously noted that Iran did not, in fact, help commit the 9/11 attacks. Late Wednesday night ( 6/29/17, correction updated 7/5/17), the Times quietly added this correction to the piece: Correction: July 6, 2017 An article on Friday about a jurys decision to let the federal government seize a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper it says is controlled by Iran overstated Irans responsibility for the September 11 attacks. That 9/11 was an Iranian-sponsored terrorist attack #160;is a spectacular claim, and one that would radically alter the official narrative of 9/11, just casually thrown into an article by the Times.

However, it's important for investors to recognize what this means and what it doesn't, as well as why the Dow's performance this year could be particularly misleading as a gauge of the market more broadly. Not only is the Dow Jones Industrial Average a flawed measuring tool, but the bulk of the gains in the stock market's wider rally have come from large-cap stocks (like Apple), particularly those with growth components. Continue Reading Below The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is the most well-known measurement of stock market performance, is having it's best year since 2013, when the index rose by 26.5%. Second, and more significant to investors, is that the Dow represents a small collection of the largest stocks in the market, and for several reasons may overstating just how the market has performed. The bottom line is that unless you're actually invested in a Dow Jones Industrial Average index fund (not common), you shouldn't pay too much heed to its behavior. Looking at the performance the Dow in the context of a few other stock indices paints a much more useful picture about how the market is doing: Don't get me wrong. Not only does the index only keep track of a small group of stocks, but a few large-cap growth stocks have been disproportionately boosting its performance this year.

Within hours of the CNBC report, however, Nokia, which does not typically comment on market rumors, said it was not preparing an offer for Juniper. Juniper shares drop after Nokia denies takeover chatter.By Supantha Mukherjee and Laharee Chatterjee (Reuters) Shares of Juniper Networks Inc (N:) fell 8 percent in pre-market trade on Thursday after Finlands Nokia (HE:) denied reports that it was in talks to buy the U.S. network gear maker. In the latest third quarter, Juniper reported a 2 percent decline in third-quarter revenue and Nokias network sales fell 9 percent to 4.8 billion euros ($5.7 billion). That valuation would imply a price of about $42 per share, a level last seen by Juniper shareholders six years ago, Morningstar analyst Ilya Kundozerov wrote in a client note. Nokia had estimated the global market to fall 4-5 percent this year, compared with a previous forecast for a 3-5 percent drop, followed by a 2-5 percent fall in 2018.

3332,"Coming into Monday's third-quarter financial report, Douglas Dynamics investors didn't expect to see strong results, but they were hoping that the new inclusion of the recently acquired Dejana business would open up new opportunities for the company. Douglas Dynamics' third-quarter results didn't quite live up to the hopes that many investors had for the company. Because of the new consolidation of the business, shipments that would have previously shown up in Douglas' results this quarter will instead be delayed into future quarters, because Dejana hasn't yet sold the equipment to end users. Douglas Dynamics wasn't able to deliver a positive surprise in its financial report, but it does seem optimistic about its future as a better-diversified company. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. The company also said that Douglas saw a more balanced sales season this year, with sales that had been deferred into the third quarter in 2015 instead taking place in the second quarter of 2016. Those are fairly wide estimates, but Douglas knows that its actual results in the fourth quarter will depend in large part on how the weather is during the early part of the winter season. Douglas estimated that the negative impact amounted to $0.17 per share, which by one measure would have produced better-than-expected bottom-line performance. The addition of Dejana will give Douglas Dynamics some much-needed diversification that should make its stock less dependent on winter weather. If conditions are worse than they have been in recent years, then Douglas will have the ability to come in toward the high end of those guidance ranges or even above them.

Tawon Boyd, 21 who had himself called 911 for assistance died Wednesday, three days after an early morning encounter with police at his home in Middle River, Maryland that ended with an officer hitting him in the head and others climbing on top of him to subdue him, according to police. Another officer arrived and spoke to Styron, who told him Boyd had been acting ""crazy"" and had been drinking and smoking marijuana, according to the report. She said it appeared from the report that the officers believed that Boyd was suffering from some kind of mental illness, and they should have treated him that way. What she found most troubling, she said, was that at no point in the initial report did any of the officers describe Boyd as posing a threat to the officers. The officer, who police identified only by his last name, Seckens, noted that Boyd ""was sweating heavily and appeared to be confused and paranoid.""

10116,"The reason, once again, is that animals are generally regarded both in the law and in the culture not as creatures possessing rights but rather as vastly inferior things to be exploited for human pleasure or killed for human convenience. For better or worse, concern for animals themselves has not motivated law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, juries, and the larger community to take animal cruelty crimes very seriously. But in addition to the assaults against his (former) wife and child in 2012, there was at least one other big warning sign that is receiving much less media attention: on August 1, 2014, Kelley was cited for animal cruelty after he had viciously beaten a Husky puppy for running away and then dragged the puppy by his neck back to his camper. Both the investigation and prosecution of animal cruelty cases can require extensive time and money. Everybody with a conscience needs to learn about the well-established link between violence against animals and violence against humans. The mere fact that nonhumans dont articulate their agony in human language hardly means that they are not experiencing agony in the first place. Both kinds of violence against humans and against non-humans are generally rooted in the same psychological defects: sadism combined with an unhealthy thirst for power, control, and (often) social status. So deliberately hurting or killing a dog may may earn the same level of punishment as deliberately destroying another persons television. These nervous systems explain why not only humans but also nonhumans exhibit both fear and pain-avoidance behavior (for example, fleeing and vocalizations such as screaming and groaning). Indeed, 56% of violent offenders have engaged in animal abuse; 46% of convicted serial murderers have admitted to torturing animals in their adolescence; 60% of child abuse cases, and 70% of domestic-partner abuse cases, involve concurrent pet abuse; and 60% of children who suffer from domestic violence go on to abuse animals.

There the feast may be a goat although those with jobs in the city would be expected to bring a wide range of goods. Tafara bought 50 baby chicks before he left, which one of his Harare-based brothers will look after. President Robert Mugabe, 85, may still be in office but the brutal system over which he presides is palpably disintegrating which gives many something to smile about.

Many of those who smoke e-cigarettes were relying on early studies that suggested they were up to 99 percent healthier than traditional cigarettes. A 2016 study found that e-cigarettes contain high levels of a cancer-causing substance called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A Harvard study found that of 51 e-cigarettes tested, at least one toxin was found in 47 of them, and 75 percent contained diacetyl, a chemical linked to a severe respiratory disease called bronchiolitis obliterans or popcorn lung. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that about half of all current cigarette smokers had tried e-cigarettes, and that more than half of people who had recently stopped smoking tobacco had tried e-cigarettes. Researchers found that vapors from e-cigarettes cause cells to release inflammatory proteins, which could lead to oral diseases. Even more frightening, the amounts of diacetyl found in 39 of the e-cigarettes contained amounts higher than the laboratory was capable of measuring. The study, which was published in Oncotarge, also found that the flavorings added to e-cigarettes made the damage worse, some more so than others. They studied 54 young cigarette and e-cigarettes smokers; 27 had mild controlled asthma and the others were healthy. In addition, e-cigarettes also contain nicotine, which is known to harm gum tissue.

The vote marked the first time that the Republican-led Congress has rejected a bid to overturn a rule imposed by President Barack Obama using the previously obscure Congressional Review Act.

Questions have arisen over where the loyalty of the General Peoples Congress (GPC) fighters lay after Saleh was killed in a roadside attack after switching sides, abandoning the Houthis in favor of a Saudi-led coalition. Sundays announcement condemned the Saudi aggression and said the party would keep resisting, but did not mention the Houthis. Yemens war, pitting the Houthis who control the capital Sanaa against the Saudi-led military alliance backing a different government based in the south, has resulted in what the United Nations calls the worlds worst humanitarian crisis. Salehs exiled son Ahmed Ali Saleh, had vowed to lead a campaign against the Houthi movement after his was killed, but the statement on Sunday did not mention his name either. The Saudi-led coalition has called on party members to join the internationally recognized government and offered an amnesty to its fighters. The statement said the party remained open to all Yemeni factions and national reconciliation. For months, the Houthis have retaliated with attacks on Saudi Arabia from its mountainous strongholds in northern Yemen and has launched around a dozen ballistic missiles at the kingdom, all of which were intercepted. What happened (Salehs killing) will not prompt us to make peace with the aggressors against the sovereignty, the dignity and the freedom of our great Yemeni people, the statement said.

5773,"Without this law, utilities would likely keep doing what theyve always done: Burn dirty fossil fuels whose cost to health and climate are devastating. The PRC proposes eliminating the Diversity Rule, which requires each utility to get 30 percent of its renewables from wind, 20 percent from solar, 5 percent from other sources like geothermal, and 1.5 percent from distributed generation like rooftop solar. The cost threshold is at the heart of the issue because its what the utilities can use to get out of meeting the renewable goals and its where you have an opportunity to take action. Without these requirements, the utilities will just buy wind energy because it costs the least. The Renewable Energy Rider on your PNM bill shows how much renewables are costing you (its worth remembering that the rest of your bill is what fossil fuels cost you). New Mexicos Renewable Energy Act creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires each utility to produce 10 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2010, at least 15 percent renewables by 2015 and at least 20 percent by 2020. For most, renewables cost a couple of dollars more a month, costs that are minimal compared to the health impacts from mining and burning coal. Right now, according to the cost threshold, renewables cannot cost you (or the utility) more than 3 percent of what you already pay.

14927,"Contact sports enhance spread of ‘superbugs,’ study finds.College athletes who play contact sports like football, rugby and soccer are more likely to carry the superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), even if they dont necessarily show any signs of infection. In a new study being presented at IDWeek 2014, college athletes in such sports are at a higher risk for being infected with MRSA and are more likely to spread the condition, which can cause serious and even life-threatening infections. After taking a monthly nasal and throat swab from each athlete over a two-year period, the researchers discovered that contact sport athletes acquired MRSA more quickly, and were colonized for longer periods than non-contact athletes. This study shows that even outside of a full scale outbreak, when athletes are healthy and there are no infections, there are still a substantial number of them who are colonized with these potentially harmful bacteria. MRSA is a bacterium that causes infections in various parts of the body, and is more difficult to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus because of its resistance to some common antibiotics. Sports teams can decrease the spread of MRSA by encouraging good hygiene in their athletes, including frequent hand washing and avoiding sharing towels and personal items such as soap and razors, said Jimenez-Truque in a statement. Research instructor Natalia Jimenez-Truque, PhD, MSCI, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, and colleagues studied the amount of time it took for college athletes in contact sports to be colonized with MRSA, and how long they carried the bacteria for. In fact, MRSA kills approximately 18,000 people each year. Symptoms are dependent upon where the patient is infected, and include skin sores, boils, infected wounds, and infection of the lungs, bloodstream and urinary tract. The researchers followed 377 athletes from Vanderbilt University who played different contact sports, like football or soccer, and compared them to athletes who played non-contact sports, like baseball or golf.",0,2

Shot to death in 1987 while attempting to escape, she was infamous at the Toledo Zoo for holding milk in her mouth for hours on end: waiting patiently until her trainers came close enough so that she could spit it out in their faces. Escapes were so common in the early days of the zoo that the Toledo Blade printed a series of cartoon editorials: each depicting various animals running through the streets and causing havoc in the local Walbridge neighborhood. After the latest Kasatka attack, one whale-researcher admitted that sometimes theyre [the orcas] not happy with their situation. Therefore, the next time you hear about an orca attack, dont dismiss it from above: Animals will be animals. In 1993, responding to increasing injuries and deaths among trainers, the park (following the lead of several others) decided to completely change its training methods.

The honest policy wonks in and outside the administration who focus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, even as they disagree with each other, usually say theres no telling if one particular course of action will work. And that line will likely get finer, for everything that Obama and the White House say about Afghanistan in the coming weeks will receive greater scrutiny. Toward the end of this briefing, another reporter took one more stab at the question, asking if Abdullahs move signaled that Afghanistan cannot actually mount a national election without fraud. That caused a journalist to inquire, Would it be accurate to say then that thousands of American troops are on duty in a country thats led by a guy who is not credible, not reliable, and running a corrupt government? But Obama and his aides must find a way to convey to the public that they do acknowledge whats truly going on, while still inspiring Americans to support the endeavor. But because the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan is so complex and the policy options so difficult to sort through, the president may have a shot at winning over the public for whatever course he choosesor at least a chance of winning time to implement his decision before public opinion turns against him. To do either, he will have to ensure that his White House does not tumble into a credibility gap, for if American voters come to believe Obama is not telling the truth about Afghanistan, they will be much less inclined to support his policy or to cut him any slack. At the same time, though, Gibbs emphasized the Obamas administrations desire to work with a strong, effective, and honest partner in Afghanistan. Yet with polls showing the public skeptical of a troop buildup in Afghanistan, any move on Obamas part to expand the war will be a hard sell.

Consider: If the U.S. prevails at little immediate cost versus the Taliban, it will bolster calls for carrying the war to other states that harbor terrorists. The Talibans command and control apparatus is too diffuse and low-tech for the U.S. to deal decisive blows from the air; the real crux is what happens on the ground, and at present the U.S. still seems to want the Northern Alliance to fight its battles there. But that may not spell the end of U.S. military engagement, because the fall of the Pushtun-dominated Taliban would create a political vacuum there is no easy way to resolve. military actions there, and it figures to engender fewer immediate complications among precariously pro-U.S. Arab regimes in the Middle East.

Exposing John Boehner’s Outrageous Ignorance Following Strong Jobs Report.Perhaps many of you heard about the recent jobs report that exceeded estimates and dropped unemployment below 6 percent for the first time since 2008. But, as always, Republicans will simply dismiss this jobs report as a lie, crappy jobs or some other asinine point of rhetoric to try to make this extremely positive news seem negative. Grown men like Boehner essentially covering up his ears, repeatedly saying, I cant hear you every time a positive jobs report comes out. Last month, when jobs numbers came in slightly below estimates, he was all over that#160;tweeting: The tweet was actually pretty comical considering August was the first bad jobs report we had seen all year. Every Friday when the jobs report is released I head over to Boehners Twitter account to see what negative bit of information hes going to tweet out concerning the report. Fun Facts Republicans Don't Want You to Know About Obama's Record on Jobs How 74,000 Jobs Completely Exposed Republican Hypocrisy After Jobs Report, Republicans Admit Trickle-Down Economics Doesn't Work 0 Facebook comments If Republicans want to argue that the jobs being created arent good paying jobs, then theyre simply admitting that trickle-down economics doesnt work. So yesterday, as I normally do when the jobs report is released, I headed on over to see what Boehner had to say and found these: All threes of these were posted literally just as the jobs report came out. It also puts Obamas overall job creation numbers well over 10 million since he became president. If anything, the timing of these three consecutive tweets suggest that he already knew the report was going to be nothing but good news for the president. They would honestly rather see this country burned to the ground before they would help President Obama improve our economy.",1,1
8436,"Using three equations for solar PV knowledge generation, manufacturing, and deployment, we investigate linkages between feed-in-tariff (FiT) and renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policies, network development, and the existence of a complementary sector. This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the interactions between different types of solar photovoltaic (PV) networks at the niche level, the complementary semiconductor sector at the complementary regime level, and the solar PV policies in 14 different countries. The empirical findings show that the complementary sector is an important determinant in solar PV deployment and manufacturing and network effects are dependent on the strength of the complementary sector in solar PV deployment and manufacturing. Feed-in-tariff and renewable portfolio standards are associated with solar PV diffusion and not with manufacturing. The Role of the Complementary Sector and its Relationship with Network Formation and Government Policies in Emerging Sectors: The Case of Solar Photovoltaics Between 2001 and 2009.Journal Article - Technological Forecasting and Social Change Understanding the role of government policies in promoting the introduction of renewable technologies can help to catalyze the transition toward a more sustainable energy system. Finally, domestic government policies promoting renewable energy markets, which often lead to domestic electricity rate increases, have contributed to increased manufacturing capabilities internationally, including also in countries without a strong complementary sector, such as China, through the channel of manufacturing collaborations from countries with a strong complementary sector. The literature on technological transitions using a multi-level perspective suggests that the co-evolution of the niche market (the new technology) and the complementary regime may have an important role to play in shaping this transition.",0,0

Our cases have been clear that the obscenity exception to the First Amendment does not cover whatever a legislature finds shocking, but only depictions of sexual conduct.#160; As Scalia put the prevailing argument that says yes to violence and no to sex, it is only violence that possesses deep cultural roots going back to our favorite fairy tales. Hear, hear to such a bold defense of the right of minors to consider a full range of controversial thought, but if the claimed harmful effects of minors exposure to violence, gore and racism do not warrant a governmental limitation on free speech, why isnt sexually prurient material for adults if not minors deserving of equal First Amendment protection? Scalias withering dismissal of Alitos concerns is revealing of his tolerance for violent imagery as opposed to that which is merely sexual: Justice Alito has done considerable independent research to identify video games in which the violence is astounding. Thus, ironically, Justice Alitos argument highlights the precise danger posed by the California Act: that the ideas expressed by speech whether it be violence, or gore, or racism and not its objective effects, may be the real reason for governmental proscription. The California law that the court struck down prohibited the sale or rental of violent games to minors in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being, unless the work, taken as a whole, possessed redeeming literary, artistic or social value qualities that limit censorship of sexually obscene material.

Moreover, we let our progressive peers (like all of those Californians who voted for Obama and in favor of the gay marriage ban) get away with homophobia because its not as obvious as those people committing hate crimes and protesting pride parades. Its ok for straight characters on the show to routinely rip each others clothes off, talk casually about sex, and change partners as frequently as they change their scrubs, but the mere discussion of lesbian sex, couched in extremely vague terms, a few tame kisses, and a fully-clothed scene in bed followed by Ericas declaration that she is so extremely gay, is too explicit. My parents loved watching Will and Grace long before they ever came close to accepting gay people. As far as we have come in our fight for gay rights, I think we have taken for granted many of the victories weve had in recent years in both legal and cultural realms, and this election serves as a painful reminder of how far we have left to go.

How is it that soccer moms across the country will watch Ellen Degeneres every day, and clap when their favorite lesbian marries her girlfriend, but when two fictional lesbian characters have a sexual relationship on a notoriously sexually explicit TV show, the American public cant handle it? I want to be so excited about the direction American politics is taking, but I cant help being worried about the lack of progress for GLBT rights and visibility, and these issues have been nagging at my mind all week.

652,"One issue thats already triggered verbal sparring is Martinezs proposal to reduce take-home pay for state workers and teachers, as the LFC did not include it in its spending plan. Unlike the governors proposal, the LFC plan calls for a modest funding increase for the judicial branch, though that would not fully offset recent cuts. Under the governors plan, all state employees there were nearly 22,000 as of last fall and teachers would have to divert an additional 3.5 percentage points of their salaries into their retirement funds, so that state-funded contributions could be decreased by a corresponding amount. Budget disputes could be a prominent theme in the coming legislative session, as Martinez vowed earlier this week to veto any proposed tax increases approved by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. Martinezs proposal calls for spending on the joint federal-state health care program that covers more than 880,000 New Mexicans to increase by $26 million during the budget year that starts in July. Meanwhile, lawmakers will also have to pass a budget for the fiscal year starting in July, and more belt-tightening is expected as state revenues are on track to come in roughly $300 million less than original spending levels for that year. Spending cuts of 5.5 percent for most state agencies would be extended, while even more would be cut from the University of New Mexico and other higher education institutions. Just like Martinezs proposal, the LFC budget recommendation would extend for another year sweeping spending cuts enacted last fall. While the Legislative Finance Committees budget recommendation does not explicitly call for tax increases, it would rely on roughly $123 million in savings that would have to come either from additional budget cuts or revenue increases. Disputes likely After having signed off on deep budget cuts and other one-time fixes in the past year, some lawmakers say state services are suffering.

Read more Johnson is already under fire and facing calls to resign after making inaccurate remarks about a British mother detained in Iran, which could potentially add a further five years to her prison sentence. John Letts and Sally Lane, who live in Oxford, said the Foreign Office, along with Minister Boris Johnson, have done nothing to help free their 22-year-old son, who they claim struggles with mental-health issues. [embedded content] The parents condemned comments made by Foreign Office Minister Rory Stewart that all UK nationals fighting with IS in Syria should be killed there rather than be allowed to return home. For that reason, we have consistently made clear over the last few years that people should not travel to Syria and parts of Iraq. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is currently serving a five-year sentence accused of attempting to overthrow the regime, insists she was in the country to introduce her then-18-month-old child to her Iranian relatives. During a Commons hearing at the beginning of the month, Johnson suggested journalist Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran training journalists when she was arrested in 2016. In a democratic system in this country, you dont have the death penalty and you cant just go and kill anyone if you think theyre guilty, Letts father, John, said. We managed to find the contact details from the prison where Jack is being held from an Amnesty report, Lane said. It seems absurd that we, as ordinary individuals, who dont have any of the machinery of government to help us, can establish our own contacts with Kurdish officials, and the government itself [is] unable to do so.

At a time when President-elect Donald Trump fetes European leaders who aim to break up the bloc, advocates of the border-free European dream need to seize every chance they can to connect with citizens. Anyone who is president of the European Parliament is going to be some kind of insider, otherwise he wouldnt be elected, said Manfred Weber, head of the largest bloc in the European Parliament, the center-right European Peoples Party. This is a deal among the establishment parties, but there are political revolutions going on in national politics, said Heather Grabbe, head of the Open Society European Policy Institute. The European Parliament is an institution that actually has a lot of power but at the end of the day, limited responsibility, since there are few ways to oust lawmakers during their five-year terms, said Alexander Stubb, who was a member of the legislature before becoming Finlands prime minister from 2014 to 2015. As Europe struggles like never before in its modern history to hold itself together, its leaders success will depend on their ability to convince citizens that the EU headquarters of Brussels serves ordinary people, not itself.

Their founder, Cheryle Moses, says she really just wanted to help people who live in and around the city bridge the racial divide particularly after all the friction of the last year. After seeing a statistic that said more than three-quarters of white Americans don't have any friends of another ethnicity, she decided she'd make it a networking goal. Moses anticipates that the ""Meet a Black Person"" event will involve a scavenger hunt, where participates will be sorted into mixed-race teams, and opportunities to learn about Atlanta's local black community. The event may be the first official one of its kind, but Moses says she hopes it won't be the last. ""In the black community we know of white people who don't have a lot of black friends,"" Moses told CNN. If the event is popular, Moses says she'll hold more and expand the outreach.

10611,"While the most problematic of the existing expatriation provisions, in terms of the voluntary nature of the expatriation, is that involving the attempted overthrow or destruction of the government, it is obvious, at least, that someone committing such acts has a profound hostility toward the United States. The prospect of a court simply inferring intent from disfavored conduct seems especially likely when considered in light of the judiciarys inconsistent record of protecting rights from government encroachment in the war on terrorism. While the government may be able to punish such support using the criminal law, citizenship is an entirely different sphere. Isnt this intent requirement an important safeguard that nullifies any worries one would otherwise have about the substantive breadth of the proposed law? [T]here is nothing in the terms, the context, the history or the manifest purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment, he stated in a footnote, to warrant drawing from it a restriction upon the power otherwise possessed by Congress to withdraw citizenship. Existing law establishes seven possible expatriating acts whose performance, together with the requisite intent, provides the grounds for loss of citizenship. In other words, if you help fund an orphanage administered by one of the three Chechen separatist groups that the government has labeled as terrorist, or if you give pharmaceutical supplies to a medical outpost run by the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, or if you are on the wrong side of any of a number of other political conflicts in the world, you may be vulnerable to losing your citizenship. Section 501 of the bill, deceptively titled Expatriation of Terrorists, would allow the presumptive denationalization of American citizens who support the activities of organizations that the executive branch has deemed terrorist. In the wake of Afroyim, Congress passed a number of amendments to the denationalization statute, including in 1976, 1978, and 1986, that codified Chief Justice Warrens view by tighting the legal rules on the loss of citizenship.

This could perhaps even lead to a new arms race beginning between NATO and Russia. They might also be seen as seeking to prevent further resupply of terrorists throughout Syria#160;by the West.

Paul added the warning #160;that the Senate GOP plan does not fix the fundamental flaw of Obamacare: That young, healthy people will just wait until they get sick to buy health insurance. The real problem we have is we won four elections on repealing Obamacare, but this bill keeps most of the Obamacare taxes, keeps most of the regulations, keeps most of the subsidies, and creates something Republicans have never been for: Thats a giant insurance bailout super fund, Sen. Paul told host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. If this comes to an impasse, if the president jumps into the fray, and says look, guys, you promised to repeal it: Lets just repeal what we can agree to and we can continue to try to fix, replace, whatever has to happen afterwards,' Paul told Wallace of his conversation with Trump on Friday. Republicans, holding a narrow 52-48 majority, need at least 50 votes counting Vice President Mike Pences tiebreaker to pass its healthcare bill known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act. Sen. Pauls hope and what he said he lobbied for directly with President Trump late this week is the alternative of scrapping the Senate GOP healthcare compromise on Obamacare for a clean repeal. In fact, most of the ideas Ive had on letting people#160;join groups to buy insurance letting the plumber and his wife join a large group like the Chamber of Commerce those ideas are welcomed by virtually every Republican. It kind of annoys me Republicans are going back on their word to repeal Obamacare. Paul continued against his lack of support for the GOP Senates latest plan because it does not fix the death spiral it merely subsidies it. Thats not a Republican idea, to give taxpayer money to a private industry that already makes $15 billion in profit. Paul also warned President Trump on his blanket promotion this weekend of the Senate GOP healthcare plan",0,4

Nowadays, hed probably be fired (if not put in jail) for thus endangering the life or health of a player, but when Coach Yoast warns him that Theres a fine line between tough and crazy, and youre flirting with it, it clashes with the evidence of our eyes. The emotionally fastidious are going to find the newly soul -full Titans triumphal progress through the hitherto lily-white world of Virginia high school football more than a little bit over the top in any case. It shouldnt be necessary to add (but probably is) that one doesnt object to the civil rights movement itself, or regret even such modest successes as that recorded in this film, but that that one does object, rather, to Hollywoods boringly incessant triumphalism about the one and only moral battle in the last 40 years in which it has been on the right side. Its not the first time we have heard either the racial or the football story, but the combination of the two adds a modest increment of novelty, and there are one or two other touching or amusing additions to the story a high school athlete crippled in a car crash on the one hand and the divorced Coach Yoasts football-mad nine year old daughter on the other. But if you go in for a certain amount of moral self-congratulation and are susceptible to heart-warming stories of hard work and striving and decency and clean living being rewarded with the palm of victory, you may well want to see this movie. Combining it with a classic (not to say clichic) football story about a high school teams undefeated season makes the pill of sanctimoniousness go down more easily, but it is hard to forget that we are being led through some very familiar paces. Of course the idea is that everybody learns not only to live together in harmony but also how to open up a can of whup-ass on the other all-white teams in the Titan",0,4
954,"Whitelaw and his colleagues, who published details of their rodent work in the journal Trends in Biotechnology, hope as a next step to build self-limiting gene drives that would burn out after a certain number of generations. Existing approaches to fighting pests, particularly mosquitoes, have so far shown mixed success, with insecticide resistance increasing in many parts of the world and drugmakers struggling to develop good vaccines against complex diseases such as dengue. Rats join mosquitoes as targets for gene drive pest control.By Ben Hirschler LONDON (Reuters) Rodents have joined mosquitoes in the cross-hairs of scientists working on a next-generation genetic technology known as gene drive to control pests. Researchers in Scotland said on Tuesday they had developed two different ways to disrupt female fertility in rats and mice, building on a similar approach that has already been tested in the lab to eliminate malaria-carrying mosquitoes. It also offers a humane way to eliminate unwanted populations of sentient mammals like rats, which are typically killed with poison and traps. Currently, an older approach called sterile insect technology is being used in some areas to fight mosquitoes. If their approach is successful, the gene drives could potentially be applied to help control a range of other non-insect pest species, such as rabbits, mink and cane toads. A key appeal of a gene drive is its durable effect on pests, whether they are disease-carrying insects or crop-eating rodents. The technique is extremely powerful but also controversial, since such genetically engineered organisms could have an irreversible impact on the ecosystem. We need to have an understanding of what gene drive can do and how it can be controlled so that decisions are based on knowledge rather than fear. So-called gene drives push engineered genes through multiple generations by over-riding normal biological processes, so that all offspring carry two copies. Still, researchers agree more work is needed on the risks and potential unintended consequences of release of such animals.",0,4
8233,"Arizona Senate Committee Endorses ‘Tell Your Boss Why You’re On The Pill’ Bill.Arizona has taken up yet another draconian law for womens healththis time replicating but broadening the federal push to let employers deny women access to birth control. Needless to say, many women do not feel comfortable turning over their medical records to their employers, even if they do have a condition that qualifies them under Leskos proposed law. Especially since, as an at-will employment state, an Arizona employer would likely be able to fire a woman if they saw anything in her gynecological history that he (or, yes, she) didnt like. The bill stipulates that, unless a woman brings in a note proving she is not using it to avoid getting pregnant, an employer can deny birth control to any woman in the workplace. By a vote of 62, an Arizona State Senate Judiciary committee yesterday endorsed the measure: Arizona House Bill 2625, authored by Majority Whip Debbie Lesko, R-Glendale, would permit employers to ask their employees for proof of medical prescription if they seek contraceptives for non-reproductive purposes, such as hormone control or acne treatment. So, government should not be telling the organizations or mom and pop employers to do something against their moral beliefs My whole legislation is about our First Amendment rights and freedom of religion. But, under the proposed law, a boss could fire the woman if the woman didnt turn it over, too. Aside from the obvious health benefits that lead some women to use birth control, contraceptive use has helped shrink the gender pay gap; it even benefits the economy as a whole. The argument that providing birth control violates the First Amendment is bogus, debunked by a twenty year-old opinion by conservative Supreme Court Justice Scalia.

8725,"In fact, Shivjis fairly superficial critique of NGOs is just the type of work that is typically promoted by reformist elites; while by way of a contrast, more radical criticisms, like for example, INCITE!s edited book The Revolution Will Not Be Funded: Beyond The Non-Profit Industrial Complex (South End Press, 2007), are conveniently ignored. (p.29) According to Shivji, silences in the NGO discourse shield the public from the following five facts: (1) NGOs are very much a part of the neoliberal onslaught on democracy, indeed the anti-state stance of the so-called donor-community was the real push behind the upsurge in NGO activity; (2) NGOs are led by and largely composed of the educated elite (falling into three categories, those previously engaged in political struggles, altruistic individuals who are morally motivated, and a mainstream careerist elite motivated by personal ambitions); (3) an overwhelming number of NGOs are donor funded; (4) perhaps the most dominant form of NGOs are donor-driven; and (5) [i]ncreasingly the model for the successful NGO is the corporation. It therefore should be a commonsense act that we scrutinize NGO activities to ascertain their exact political function within the our neoliberal world order, yet this is not normally the case. This theoretical detachment from the world around them means that the common sense theoretical assumption of the current period underpinning NGO roles and actions is neoliberalism in the interest of global imperialism. As Firoze Manji observes in the publications foreword: often dressed up with the verbiage of participatory approaches, [o]ver the last two decades, development NGOs have become an integral, and necessary, part of a system that sacrifices respect for justice and rights. This is problematic as understanding the long and dirty history of liberal philanthropy is integral to comprehending the deeper phenomena that undergird the imperialist evolution of the NGO-driven change industry. Unless there is awareness on the part of NGOs of this fundamental moment in the struggle between imperialism and nationalism, they end up playing the role of ideological and organisational foot soldier",1,1

Samsung set the tone of its news conference with a video showcasing its safety testing procedures rather than touting the past years successes or offering a flashy product announcement. With the Note 7, Samsung flubbed an opportunity to score points off Apple, which in 2016 reported a year-long decline in iPhone sales for the first time. Samsung also showed off the Galaxy Book, a tablet that comes with a keyboard and stylus, which kicks off a new product line to compete with Apples iPad Pro and Microsofts Surface line. The company focused its presentation on new tablets, while announcing that its next phone will get its time in the spotlight at a March 29 launch event. Samsung also made a point to court the same creative class of customers artists and designers who can take full advantage of its stylus as have Apple and Microsoft. Samsung is recommitting to its higher performance units, which offer better profit margins and opportunities to enhance the brand, said Rhoda Alexander, director at IHS Technology, in a research note shortly after the presentation. The next Galaxy phone will be a crucial test for Samsung, which had waged a successful campaign to chip away at Apples iPhone before the Note 7 crisis. The impact these problems have had on Samsungs relationship with its customers has been difficult to quantify, but analysis firm IDC reported that Apple regained its lead over Samsung in smartphone shipments in the last quarter of 2016. The company did not elaborate on why the phones launch will come later, but it said last month when it reported the results of the Note 7 investigation that it may delay its new phones debut.

What the article does not mention is that the department is still woefully short of boots on the ground the social workers desperately needed to quickly investigate allegations of abuse and neglect and then spend the time needed to monitor the well-being of the children and help their caretakers learn how to parent. In a single week this past spring, one company (Molina) hired away almost a dozen social workers, increasing their pay from something under $40,000 to $55,000 for unlicensed social workers and to something under $70,000 for licensed social workers. This approach has the advantage of keeping increases in the budget to a minimum; it has the overwhelming disadvantage of still leaving social workers and Childrens Court attorneys massively overworked. Another would be a major commitment of resources to contact every expectant couple and stay with them for several years as needed to offer parent training and child safety services. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps the biggest deficit in the departments Band-Aid approach is the failure to think expansively about the problem; that is, to consider whether a serious prevention program might be better than only intervening after the damage is done sometimes too late, as with Omaree Varela. Susana Martinez has proposed a slight increase for some of the social workers, but what she has also done (not mentioned in the article) is lowered the standards for supervising social workers by dropping the requirement that a supervisor be licensed.

Continue Reading Below The analyst upgrades came fast and furious following Micron's report, with price targets being boosted as high as $50 per share. Micron's DRAM bit volume only grew by 1% compared to the first quarter, but a 21% rise in average sales price drove revenue higher. Average sales price dropped 6%, suggesting that supply isn't nearly as tight as it is in the DRAM market, but a 15% drop in cost per bit more than offset that decline. Slapping a multiple on peak earnings for a cyclical company like Micron isn't a good idea. Micron stock could certainly go higher if these strong results persist, and the company's guidance suggests that they will for at least another quarter. Everything is going right for Micron, and it's looking like the third quarter is going to set records on multiple fronts. The perfect storm of strong demand and low supply in the DRAM market is set to continue, with Micron reaping the rewards. The bottom line responded in kind, and Micron expects the third quarter to be even better. With the supply of DRAM chips tight and demand for NAND chips soaring, memory chip maker Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) was able to put up stellar numbers when it reported its second-quarter results on March 23.

If demand for smaller, shorter contracts or spot market shipments to FSRUs continue to be such a lucrative market, don't be surprised if Cheniere's expansion plans dedicate a larger portion to these kinds of contracts rather than its long-term, fixed-fee contracts. One thing to keep in mind is that distributable cash flow is related to Cheniere Energy Partners (NYSEMKT: CQP), which is the entity that owns Sabine Pass. These ships act as temporary, mobile LNG import terminals that are ideal for places where the economics for a larger, fixed facility don't make sense or where seasonal demand fluctuations may require additional import capacity.

Retailers, from Amazon.com to Wal-Mart, were also offering online deals as Thanksgiving has become one of the biggest online shopping days of the year. MIXED VIEWS ON EARLY START Earlier on Thursday, a line outside a Best Buy in Union, N.J., included shoppers who had pitched a tent to stay warm until the store's midnight opening, according to Charles O'Shea, a Moody's senior retail analyst. To narrow the gap in store hours with rivals, discounter Target Corp, electronics chain Best Buy and department store chains Macy's Inc and Kohl's Corp will open at midnight - their earliest starts ever. The knock-down-drag-out fight comes as the rebound in sales cooled in October, when many top chains like Macy's and Saks reported disappointing sales. ""Tonight all the stores decided to open at midnight which is difficult when you're trying to enjoy dinner with your family,"" said Louis Clapper, 24, as he shopped at the Walmart in Farmingdale, New York. Shoppers were looking for bargains, but customers like James McBreaty were just what retailers wanted -- those who will also buy things beyond the ""doorbuster"" deals retailers offer to entice customers. Bargain hunters flocked to U.S. stores late Thursday and overnight Friday, searching for deals while fretting about their own shaky economic well-being. At Macy's in Herald Square, several Occupy Wall Street activists chanted ""boycott Macy's"" and ""stop supporting big corporations"" even as 9,000 people lined up to shop at the store. Those midnight openings drew online petition protests from store workers, and some shoppers also did not like the early openings. ",1,3

2418,"In April of this year, Christen Hagemann, an attorney for the Downs, wrote a letter to State Fair Commission Chairman Larry Kennedy to advise him that Dynamic Communications had bid on two contracts and that the Downs had learned the company was headed by the husband of Charlotte Rode. The letter asked Kennedy to contact the Downs if the State Fair Commission objected to Dynamic Communications getting the work. Now we learn that Dynamic Communications, whose president is Michael Rode, the commissioners husband, was hired earlier this year by the Downs to do work on the new casino. Charlotte Rode said that because of the potential appearance of impropriety and because she isnt a fan of how the Downs conducts its business, she would have preferred that Dynamic Communications not seek the work. A company headed by the husband of State Fair Commissioner Charlotte Rode was hired by the Downs at Albuquerque to do telecommunications work on its new casino at the state fairgrounds. Charlotte Rode said she confirmed that with her husband shortly after getting the email but said she still didnt know whether the company had actually done any work for the Downs. Kennedy said he sent a copy of the letter to a state assistant attorney general, who recommended the commission take no action in response to the Downs letter because a contract between the Downs and Dynamic Communications would be a private matter. In a phone interview last week, Charlotte Rode said she learned in June in an email from a KKOB radio talk show host that Dynamic Communications had put in a bid for work at the casino. Mike Rode told me he is a one-third owner of Dynamic Communications and oversees the companys finances. He said he wasnt aware until afterward that the companys sales staff had bid on work at the casino. The State Fair Commission, with Rode in the minority, voted 4-3 in November 2011 to award the 25-year lease to the Downs. In November 2011, State Fair Commissioner Benny Roybal proposed that the commission vote on a prohibition against its members receiving financial benefits from the Downs, but the commission never voted on the proposal.",0,0

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan, speaking at an energy conference here, said he might support an increase at the Fed's December policy meeting, but he wants to watch how the economy performs for a while before making a decision. He supported the Fed's two rate increases in March and June, but said during the summer he wanted to see more evidence of firming inflation before raising rates again.

Although Bloombergs personal relationship with the Clintons likely informed his decision to endorse the familys well-connected Manhattan matriarch, open rebellion against the GOPs controversial nominee is not unique this election season. As the race stands now, with Republicans in charge of both Houses, there is a good chance that my candidacy could lead to the election of Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, wrote Bloomberg in the publication bearing his namesake. ""Dismayed by Donald Trump, Michael Bloomberg Will Endorse @HillaryClinton"" During the primary election season, Bloomberg considered running as a third-party candidate for president, citing the muted enthusiasm for the leading parties inevitable nominees. Bloombergs endorsement comes at a time when lifelong Republicans are openly considering voting for the GOP's number one enemy: Hillary Clinton. Although Bloomberg ran for New York City mayor as a Republican in 2000 after leaving the Democratic Party disillusioned, he never felt at quite at home as a member of the Grand Old Party.

Bloomberg remains one of the few big city mayors with a national profile, following in the footsteps of his perhaps more well-known predecessor Rudy Giuliani. Many Democrats at the time considered Millers unexpected endorsement to be a betrayal, especially since the Georgia senator was a keynote speaker for Bill Clintons DNC convention 12 years prior. Bloomberg will argue the case for Clinton from the perspective of a business leader and an independent, said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to the former mayor, to The New York Times.

Last week it was#160;abouthow#160;we lucky Medicare-eligible#160;oldsters are scarfing up our free health care while#160;our#160;slightly younger#160;compatriots (ages 50-65) cant even get health insurance. Want to know the real reason why the worlds#160;wealthiest nation cant find money in its budget to lift nearly one in five#160;of its#160;children out of poverty? So let me get this straight: The only way for the children of America to get the health care they need is for old people to give up some of ours? Just about every week, it seems, the New York Times#160;has yet#160;another piece that adds fuel to what Ive called the phony intergenerational conflictover health care. Never mind#160;the insurance companies,#160;whose useless, bloodsucking participation in the U.S. health care system raises costs by at least 20 percent. One might be tempted to think the spending imbalance reflects a difference in needs. Porter takes things a step further, suggesting that its old folks gluttony at the public trough that leaves millions of American children living in poverty: The age gap sheds light on a deep generational inequity. Social spending on the elderly amounted to $19,700 per person in 2000, according to one study; children got $6,380. After all, the elderly tend to get sick more and require expensive medical treatment. The real reason little Timmy and Janey cant afford to go to the doctor is because their selfish old granny wanted a hip replacement, and grandpa insisted on having his blood pressure meds.

After taking into account factors such as social deprivation, ethnicity, employment, medications, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and television viewing time, the team found that those who described themselves as slow walkers were around twice as likely to have a heart-related death compared to brisk walkers, and also had a higher risk of death from all causes. The team now believe that self-reported walking pace could be used to identify individuals with low physical fitness and high mortality risk who would benefit from physical exercise interventions. Associations between self-reported walking pace and handgrip strength and cancer-related deaths were also not consistent. The team also analyzed a possible relationship between handgrip strength and the two diseases, however they found that it was only a weak predictor of heart-related deaths in men and were unable to generalize the findings across the population as a whole.

Data was collected between 2006 and 2010, with all participants free of cancer and heart disease at the time of collecting their information. Participants were asked to self-report their usual walking pace as either slow, steady/average or brisk. The findings can be found in the European Heart Journal.#160;",0,4

When threatened, the American people, with all of their tolerance and greatness, will come to a threshold of rebellion and will no longer be restrained. There came a point in American historyApril 19, 1775that the colonists could no longer tolerate oppression of the occupying forces that consumed their rights and led to the revolution. There will be one moment, a Lexington and Concorde moment, and a shot or an action will become so vivid in the minds of the American people that they no longer can stay silent and no longer sit on the sidelines. The Federal Government will try to turn its own people against one another with the use of the military and police forces. The peoples rights are protected by the Constitution but this goes far beyond that founding document and reaches into the very soul of man the very right of the individual to protect himself, his family and his property. When people having those qualities believe their very souls are threatened, they will rise up and stop at nothing to abolish their predator. A phrase will be uttered but this time in the halls of Congress: I fear that all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve. It was a moment in history, which not only shocked the Kingdom of Great Britain, but also set off a cascade effect that is still felt today. If this is done it very well could be a greater struggle than the one embedded in our heritage, which started in April 19, 1775 in Middlesex County within the towns of Lexington and Concorde.

Logan Churchwell, a spokesman for True the Vote, a Houston-based nonprofit that trains citizens for poll watching as part of its campaign against voter fraud, said such observers play a necessary and central role in improving voter confidence, irrespective of political agendas.

Actor Josh Gad, who lends his voice to a dog in the film, issued a statement on Twitter saying he has asked the studio and production team for an explanation of what he calls ""disturbing images."" ""No matter how the film performs this weekend, there is virtually no way to accurately quantify how the ultimate gross receipts for the film may have been impacted by the negative publicity,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker comScore. The minute-long clip shows a trainer trying to put a resistant German shepherd named Hercules into a turbulent pool and the dog scrambling out. Last week, Amblin and Universal released a joint statement when canceling the press day and premiere that read in part, ""While we are all disheartened by the appearance of an animal in distress, everyone has assured us that Hercules the German Shepherd was not harmed throughout the filmmaking."" Since the video surfaced Jan. 18 on TMZ.com and quickly went viral, fallout has been extensive, including: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has called for a boycott of ""A Dog's Purpose."" Mark Stubis of American Humane said its investigation should be completed by Friday, but that preliminary findings indicate that the two scenes in the clip were shot at different times and edited together. Polone, who describes himself as a vegan whose closest relationships are with animals, says the actions in the video are ""inexcusable and never should have happened,"" and blames the American Humane representative on set for not intervening immediately. Stubis said production was stopped after the dog showed signs of stress on the day in question and that Hercules ""was not forced to swim in the water during this take.""

PENNSYLVANIA: Clinton +1.9 Clinton's once dominant lead In Pennsylvania dramatically decreased over the final two weeks of the campaign. After dramatic movement for Trump in late May, including a brief national lead following the Republican National Convention and the FBI's damaging report on Clinton's private email server, the two candidates were deadlocked at 44.3% on July 29, the day after the Democratic National Convention. On the morning of the election, Hillary Clinton holds the edge over Trump, though her once commanding national lead now stands at 3 points and she's lost the advantage in several key battleground states. As of Nov. 5, Clinton holds only a 1.9-point lead in the four-way surveys (46.2 44.3), a more than 6-point slip from a month ago, when she held an over 9-point lead, and within the margin of error. In late August, Clinton's lead began to slip as Trump made a series of smart political movesincluding visiting Louisiana in the aftermath of the flooding, meeting with the president of Mexico, and giving a number of strong policy speecheswhile Clinton appeared to be bunkering down amid more bad headlines about the Clinton Foundation, her private email server, and her continued health problems. In general, over the last two weeks most of the races have moved in Trump's direction, with the Republican managing to flip three key states (Nevada, North Carolina and Arizona). After suffering a bloody October, where all of the business mogul's positive momentum from September was undone, he climbed again in the national polls over the last two weeks of the campaign, while Clinton faltered following a series of deeply damaging headlines, most notably the reopening of the FBI's investigation into her private email server. ): As of Nov. 7, RCP's general election average for the four-candidate race which includes the Libertarian",1,3

Theres no question a lot of transgender students and their parents woke up Wednesday morning really scared, said Sarah McBride, a 26-year-old transgender activist who is national press secretary for the LGBT-rights group the Human Rights Campaign. Kelly Shackelford, head of First Liberty Institute, a legal group that specializes in religious freedom cases, said that, for his cause, the environment will transform from brutal under the Obama administration to friendly given GOP control of both Congress and the White House. In a letter last month to Catholics, Trump decried what he called hostility to religious freedom and pledged, I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions. Modder, among military veterans who met with Trump in September, said he was very hopeful that Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence, a religious conservative, will advance policies that would prevent recurrences of what happened to him. Their only major victory came when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled two years ago in favor of Hobby Lobby, the Christian-owned arts and crafts chains with faith objections to the birth control coverage requirement in the Affordable Care Act. LGBT activists are now wondering if same-sex marriage legalized nationwide by a 2015 Supreme Court ruling is in jeopardy given the prospect of Trump appointing conservative justices who might reconsider that decision. And the push to let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice at school, strongly backed by President Barack Obama, may wither in the face of GOP resistance. Due to the election results, Schultz expects the Justice Department will be friendlier to religious conservatives, and Congress more willing to enact legislation that advances conscience protections.

People who think they might be able to use the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 as a defense against the New York gun law are mistaken. Stossel has a video on his Facebook page in which he calls New York Assistant District Attorney Jack Ryan a sadistic bully for enforcing the gun law by arresting people and costing them thousands of dollars to defend themselves in court. The stakes are sky-high, Dave, and the NRA appears to be inching toward the finish line here so we need to know where you stand on this issue before its too late What theyre not telling recipients of this message is that criminals already carry from state to state, and they never bother with licenses or permits. Stossel sums it up: New York lawmakers do not want you to have a gun. He notes, Roughly once a week, New York City locks up people for carrying guns legally licensed by other states. 1 priority is forcing Congress to pass concealed carry reciprocity legislation which would allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons across state lines. Earlier this week, SAF warned law-abiding gun owners to avoid traveling to, or through, California because of its extremist gun control laws. And in New York, if you dont have a New York gun license, youre subject to felony arrest. If this passes, every town in every state will needlessly become more dangerous and vulnerable to acts of gun violence. Regardless, opposition to that legislation has ramped up in the form of an email blast by the Seattle-based Alliance for Gun Responsibility.

They, along with SBC missionaries T and Kathie Thomas in Romania, were introduced at the CBF 1992 General Assembly as the first four missioners, as the Fellowships field personnel were known at the time. Rather than letting the seminary die, the Hoppers resigned after 27 years as Southern Baptist missionaries in April 1992. The newly formed Cooperative Baptist Fellowship responded by offering to cover the salaries of missionaries who could no longer in good conscience stay affiliated with the Foreign Mission Board. In 1988 the FMB agreed to transfer ownership of the seminary to European Baptists and a gradual subsidy reduction for as long as 15 years beginning in 1992.

For another example of the right way to respond to school violence, look no further than Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, site of the 1999 massacre of 12 students and a teacher by two heavily armed students. Because Littleton, Colorado, is a largely affluent community with political muscle, theyve been able to resist the avalanche of punitive measures that have been generated by every school massacre since the one that took place at theirs.

Pandora's strategic options appear increasingly tenuous, which is why the news that Pandora has retained Morgan Stanley to explore a potential sale shouldn't be a surprise. Spotify and Apple Music's international expansion could limit Pandora's upside on the same stage, though, so things aren't all coming up roses for Pandora. Pandora's efforts appear exploratory for now, but its willingness to consider removing itself from the scrutiny of public markets doesn't exactly send an upbeat signal regarding the company's outlook. According to reporting from The New York Times, Pandora recently enlisted Morgan Stanley to kick the tires to see if any interested parties might be inclined to buy it. With Pandora's arguable edge on the radio side, its value proposition could make it competitive with Spotify or Apple Music. What's more, moving into on-demand will require Pandora to negotiate its royalties directly with the record labels, which lays the foundation for the company to finally expand beyond its four-country geographic footprint. That Pandora finds itself in this situation, despite having been the first online digital-music purveyor, reflects the mismanagement of the company's strategy over the past five years.

A college student sued Nelly over an alleged sexual assault.A 22-year-old student at the University of Washington in Seattle on Wednesday sued rapper Nelly, according to The Seattle Times. Prosecutors in King County, Washington last week opted not to charge Nelly with a crime as Greene declined to assist their efforts through an attorney. It comes as no surprise that Ms. Green [sic] filed a lawsuit against Nelly seeking money after we announced our intention to hold her accountable, he said. Greene became increasingly upset after the incident, prompting Nelly to eject her from the vehicle in the parking lot of a Walmart in Auburn, Washington. The Times on Wednesday reported that Monique Greenes lawsuit claims Nelly sexually assaulted her in October and then defamed her in his public denials. She honestly decided to stand up for herself after that last horrible post they made against her, Greenes Seattle attorney said Wednesday. Scott Rosenblum, Nellys attorney, on Wednesday said in a statement that Greenes lawsuit is financially motivated. Nelly ultimately hosted Greene, who had been drinking that night, on his tour bus early the morning of Oct. 7 when the alleged sexual assault occurred. Ms. Greene was physically pushed out of the bus and Defendant Nelly threw a $100 bill at her then closed the bus door and said bye bye, the document adds. Auburn police arrested Nelly whose real name is Cornell Haynes Jr. later in October, when he insisted the sex between him and Greene was consensual.

Drugstores, which had spent years opening locations nationwide, offered plenty of places for people to quickly get flu shots to guard against that global pandemic. Retailers say their pharmacists can notify a customers primary care doctor that the patient had a flu shot, if the patient gives them the contact information, and their expansion into vaccinations isnt meant to replace a primary care doctor visit. In fact, nearly half of all flu vaccines provided to adults are now administered in non-medical settings like drugstores or worksite clinics. The nations biggest drugstores and other retailers are grabbing larger chunks of the immunization market, giving customers more convenient options outside the doctors office to protect themselves against the flu, pneumonia and other illnesses. The nations biggest drugstores and retailers are grabbing larger chunks of the immunization market, giving customers more convenient options to protect themselves against the flu, pneumonia and more than a dozen other illnesses. Retailers, some of which also offer vaccinations against diseases such as yellow fever and chickenpox, dont disclose how much they make off vaccines. The first flu shot Lynn Bruggemann got was an impulse purchase she made in 2011 while visiting a CVS store to buy toothpaste and shampoo. Some vaccines also are designed to protect against four flu viruses instead of the usual three. Doctors often use flu shot appointments to ask patients about chronic conditions such as diabetes they may be treating, said Dr. Robert Wergin, a family physician in Milford, Nebraska, and president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Continue Reading Below That may be overstating things, a bit, but the relatively sunny conclusion of a recent survey by Natixis Global Asset Management indicates that investors think that good times will prevail or at least that a market crash is too unpleasant to even consider. Although survey respondents fear a market correction, they think that there is little they can do about it, thus they forge ahead as if good times were guaranteed. There is one other dangerous ratio that the survey identified the willingness to take risks compared to financial planning, or at least the ability to follow through on planning. On the planning side, investors appear to understand the value of advice and risk management, yet often ignore it or do not follow through. We could all use a little optimism just do not forget about and abandon financial advice, proper planning, and risk management. Keep in mind that the survey was conducted in February 2015, and given the Greek crisis and other current events as of the end of June 2015, the results would likely be different today although we suspect optimism would still carry the day. John Hailer, CEO of Natixis for Asia and the Americas, put it this way: ""American investors have gotten used to excellent stock market returns in the last few years, so their view of financial markets is notably positive"" and "" the missing piece is that many have not really planned, or prepared themselves emotionally, for another market setback.""

Alphabet (NASDAQ:) Incs self-driving car unit Waymo in May announced plans to test with ride services company Lyft, and Alphabet is now considering an investment in Lyft. Testing a ride service underscores GMs ambitions to adapt its business in the face of a potential shift in the car industry from individual ownership to transportation as a service.

Equifax, which creates individual credit reports used by lenders to assess a consumer's creditworthiness, has come under intense pressure from senators and members of the House in recent days for what has been described as a slow, inadequate and confusing response to the hack. ""I am troubled by this attack - described as 'one of the largest risks to personally sensitive information in recent years' - and by the fact that it represents the third recent instance of a data breach of Equifax or its subsidiaries that has endangered American's personal information,"" she wrote in a letter to Equifax chairman and chief executive Richard Smith.

The remaining wild lands of America can still serve to teach us the necessity of caution, the idea that not all places are meant for development and bulldozers. Specifically, Stegner was asked to consider the Robbers Roost country in Wayne County, Utah, near the Capitol Reef National Monument.#160; Of this he wrote: In that desert climate the dozer and jeep tracks will not soon melt back into the earth, but the country has a way of making the scars insignificant.

Although it should be noted that, no doubt, some parks, like Yosemite and Glacier, do in fact have swaths of real and vast wilderness (in addition to what some refer to as front country). And most important of all, they highlight the idea of essential limits in our relationship with nature, the idea that we shouldnt turn every parcel of land over to development. In 1960, as activists were organizing their push for the Wilderness Act, Wallace Stegner, perhaps one of Americas best western writers, was asked to articulate the principle of wilderness. What Martin also fails to note is that the NPS always had as its mission to offer places for people to explore, not just places to protect from outside encroachment. To begin with, theres a big difference between the National Park System and wilderness. The Park Service, for its part, Martin adds, announced in May that it will start to offer naming rights to corporate donors. Pile the kids into the car and descend on national parks to see wildlife or snap pictures of mountain ranges, cacti, or other natural wonders. Save a piece of country like that intact, and it does not matter in the slightest that only a few people every year will go into it.",1,1

4169,"So what to make of the revelation that Clinton avoided official email entirely while at State? The Clintons unfortunate tendency to be their own worst enemy is on display, again, with reports that, as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton conducted official business solely from a personal email account. That Clinton has recently turned over 55,000 pages of email records in response to an overdue burst of documentary housekeeping by State does not excuse her lack of compliance while in office. If Clinton is emailing with world leaders or others about official business, the entire point of the Federal Records Act is to ensure that those communications are captured for history. Nonetheless, by the time Clinton assumed office in 2009, nobody in government understood that a high-level official would solely use a private email system, said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle amp; Reath and former director of litigation for the National Archives and Records Administration. The National Archives, which oversees such collection, had this to say in 2013 about the use of personal email accounts: While agency employees should not generally use personal email accounts to conduct official agency business, there may be times when agencies authorize the use of personal email accounts, such as in emergency situations when federal accounts are not accessible or when an employee is initially contacted through a personal account. If officials also used private accounts, he added, regulations in place at the time provided that you need to transfer those emails to an official record-keeping system. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell writes about his effort to use the then-newfangled email system to communicate with counterparts overseas. ADVERTISEMENT Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill declined to detail why she had chosen to conduct State Department business from her personal account, reported The New York Times, which broke the story. Merrill said that because Clinton was communicating with other State Department officials on their government accounts, she had every expectation they would be retained, the Times added. To back up: The Federal Records Act requires agencies to maintain records of official business, including emails.

And to see a community for an hour and a half say you are not going to disappear another person, we're not going to allow you to take the space that we have for three days of black love, of accountability, a strategy session, of challenging discussions, of tears of joy, of five-year-olds in freedom schools to 92-year-olds to folks that are disabled, to again, the trans community really taking leadership. And for the next hour and a half there were over 200, or I would say 150 to 200 people that locked down on Euclid and 22nd right on Cleveland State University's campus, and were saying that this child was not going to be taken and they were not going to leave until his mother got there and he was released into the custody of his mother. And as that was happening, obviously as people are walking, people are stopping, some of the women organizers had reached out to him to make sure that he could pass the numbers so that they could call his mother since he was a minor, he was 14 years old. But so as we understand, this was not in response to activists engaged in a march, or some sort of action, but this was more of an individual incident around which activists gathered to show community support and strength, and making sure that this young man was not abused further? I think what that did was finally bring everybody together into a space to say, now we can carry this forward as we build nationally and internationally, what do we do every day home on a very localized level. So immediately, these are organizers and activists in the Black Lives Matter movement, and they began to record, they began to question the police, form a perimeter around the car, and were basically saying we're not going to let you take him.

Rajinder Bhandari, a former president of the BJP in Punjab and vice chairman of the Punjab State Planning Board, thinks that the unemployment problem would be solved if young people with degrees, who are fundamentally unskilled, would find all jobs from plumbing to farming respectable. The youth along with the majority of Indian voters wanted change, but many districts were hesitant to support an untested party like AAP. Though the movement lost momentum with the government ultimately accepting a watered-down version of Hazares demands six months later the political party AAP was born out of the movement in November 2012. I thought of joining politics so that we get power to change the system, Singh said in the lobby of a Country Inn along a dusty highway in Talwandi Sabo, Punjab. One in every third educated young person in India did not have a job in 2012, according to Indias Labor Department. Ultimately, Singh says, given the byzantine corrupt political system in India, he does not think true change will happen unless the AAP is at the nations helm. A septuagenarian social activist named Anna Hazare came to Delhi and began a hunger strike within a mile of the Parliament to bring attention to a movement called India Against Corruption. School kids are taught by parents to crave well-paid jobs in Delhi, and when that vision does not deliver, they cannot craft alternate futures, he said. New Delhi, a half-hour flight away from Singhs Punjab, was reeling from a scandal around of all things toilet paper. Working as a cashier at an Indian food stall in a food court near the citys airport, he roomed in apartment with 15 other young men, all from Punjab, and began to recognize the plight of the Punjabi diaspora working abroad.

Analyzing 15 years of data for underground bituminous mines with what she calls a more comprehensive data analysis approach and updated data, she finds significant safety benefits to unionization: I find that unionization predicts a substantial and significant decline in traumatic mining injuries and fatalities, the two measures that I argue are the least prone to reporting bias. Yet according to a recent study by Stanford law professor Alison D. Morantz, previous studies have found no strong correlation between unionization and improved safety in minesin fact, some have indicated union mines were more dangerous. It said the companys substandard mine seals, the mines ventilation system, the lack of adequate oxygen devices inside mine shafts, no safety chambers, no two-way communications, no tracking devices, and no onsite, experienced mine rescue teams all played roles in the tragedy.

The fence, which Kabul opposes, will run down the middle of so-called divided villages where few people have passports and Pashtun tribal loyalty often trumps allegiance to the state. Pakistani officials in Baluchistan are now working on shifting Pakistani citizens in the divided villages to their side of the fence and say security worries override concerns that it will break up communities. But in recent years, several populist leaders have advocated building walls to curtail movement of foreigners, most notably U.S. President Donald Trump, who wants a wall along the entire border with Mexico. Pakistan, in anticipation of the fence, plans to build more than 100 new border posts and Islamabad is recruiting in excess of 30,000 soldiers to man them, according to a senior military source. Kabul and Islamabad accuse each other of sheltering militants and providing safe havens for Islamist groups who carry out cross-border attacks.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday criticized sanctuary cities that try to protect immigrants in the country illegally as places that undermine the moral authority of the law.

Sessions told the law enforcement officers in Portland that city officials in these sanctuary jurisdictions feign outrage when they lose federal funds as a direct result of actions designed to nullify plain federal law. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it asked the Multnomah County Sheriffs Office to prevent Martinez release so the agency could take him into custody. Sessions said the federal grant money that U.S. cities receive are not an entitlement, and cannot be given to sanctuary cities that he said frustrate efforts to reduce crime.

According to a criminal complaint and arrest warrant affidavit, the victim was walking at about 6 a.m. when she was approached from behind by a man wielding a knife who ordered her to give him $10. Three years later after he was convicted of another crime and New Mexico had a DNA law he was identified with DNA evidence. Attack on Woman Described..................................................................................................................................................................................... A suspect in the case, Francisco R. Perez, 27, was arrested Thursday and charged with kidnapping and multiple counts of criminal sexual penetration and criminal sexual contact. The victim told the man all she had with her were her house keys and a cell phone, which he took, according to the documents. After she refusing his order to engage in a sex act, the man forced her to walk between some portable buildings at the school, where he tied her hands with a cord from her jacket. During the attack, the man set the knife on the ground and the woman grabbed it and threatened him, according to the documents.

Just as he took on a role as a high-profile critic of President Donald Trump and prepared to launch a re-election campaign, Murray was hit Thursday with a political bombshell accusations from three men that Murray sexually abused them in the 1980s. Seattle mayor denies sex abuse claims – ‘simply not true’..................................................................................................................................................................................... SEATTLE Ed Murray led a long campaign to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington state, toiled for nearly two decades as a state lawmaker and won his biggest personal political victory in 2013 when he unseated Seattles incumbent mayor by promising the ultra-liberal city to raise the minimum hourly wage to $15. On Friday, Murray held a brief news conference to deny allegations in a lawsuit by one man, saying they were very painful for me. The two others who made allegations against Murray told The Seattle Times ( they met him while living in a Portland center for troubled teens. The 2013 mayoral race was a bruising campaign that focused on whether Murray would be more liberal and effective than incumbent Mike McGinn, a fellow Democrat, in the notoriously difficult city to govern because of competing liberal factions and an older, established political order resistant to change. In the lawsuit filed Thursday, however, the man had said he had sought mental health counseling and was taking part in addiction-recovery programs. Calls to city councilmembers earlier for Friday for comment about the mayor and what impact the allegations could mean for his political future went unreturned. Murray, 61, grew up in working class neighborhoods in and around Seattle as one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family and became one of the states most prominent political figures.

12362,"According to Reuters: Some Turkish and Israeli analysts say that Turkey's motive is not to seek a showdown with Israel over Gaza, but to build up a naval presence between Cyprus and Israel to create a sense of menace and scare investors away from the gas fields there. Turkish ships will escort Gaza aid, prime minister says.Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan amped up Turkey's dispute with Israel on Thursday by announcing that Turkish warships will escort any Turkish vessels delivering aid to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. On Friday, Turkey expelled the Israeli ambassador in Ankara, suspended military deals and said it would have a greater naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The current spat between the two countries started last week when the United Nations released a report that found Israel used ""excessive"" force when it raided a Gaza-bound Turkish-flagged protest flotilla in 2010, but said Israel was entitled to its blockade of Gaza. Turkey has NATO's second biggest military and its navy is considered to be superior to that of Israel, which has expanded patrols in the eastern Mediterranean to enforce the Gaza blockade, Reuters reports. Turkey has been chafing at Cypriot-Israeli energy deals, and the tensions with Israel could enable Ankara to send a message without making explicit threats. Turkey wants Israel to apologize for the raid, which left nine pro-Palestinian activists dead, but Israel has refused, saying it acted in self-defense. Erdogan also said Turkey would stop Israel unilaterally exploiting natural resources from the eastern Mediterranean, according to al-Jazeera's Arabic translation of excerpts of an interview conducted in Turkish, the Guardian reports. (More from GlobalPost: Turkey suspends defense trade with Israel) Israeli ministers have tried to pass off the imbroglio as spilt milk.

A peaceful protest over the death of a man at police hands, in a community where locals have been given every reason to mistrust the forces of law and order, is one sort of political statement. Penny Red (posted on Aug. 9) via @JPBarlow: In the scramble to comprehend the riots, every single commentator has opened with a ritual condemnation of the violence, as if it were in any doubt that arson, muggings and lootings are ugly occurrences. Unquestionably there is far, far more to these riots than the death of Mark Duggan, whose shooting sparked off the unrest on Saturday, when two police cars were set alight after a five-hour vigil at Tottenham police station.

A 2001 audit ( PDF) conducted after its first year of operations found that while the state had paid it to educate more than 2,000 students during one month, a mere seven kids had actually logged on to ECOTs computer system; state auditors couldnt verify that the rest of its student body even existed. In a December interview with Nick Gillespie, editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, Bush said he sees digital learning as a transformative tool to disrupt the public education system, to make it more child-centered, more customized, more robust, more diverse, more exciting. Over the past year, hes emerged as one of the nations most prominent boosters of virtual schools, touring the country to promote technology as an instrument of creative destruction against the public school system.

619,"Drafting blinkered nationalist arguments or with appropriate inducements from Israel and India the Iranians too could begin to see plenty of advantages in an alliance with Israel against Pakistan. The General is being asked to give proof positive of his partnership in the war against global terrorism by reversing Pakistans strategic opposition to the unnatural creation of Israel. The General wants Pakistanis to believe that recognizing Israel will be good for their country. If the narrow nationalism that is being peddled in Pakistan to justify recognizing Israel were genuine if Pakistani nationalism ever had a spine it would remain suspect. Yet, the present rulers of Iran, a country whose claims to nationalism are more firmly grounded than Pakistans, have remained steadfast in their support of the Palestinian cause. General Musharraf and the Recognition of Israel.It appears that General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistans military dictator since October 1999, is on a mission to legitimize Israel: and he is going about it with the zeal of a new convert. Let the Pakistanis also consider momentarily the implications of an Iran driven by nationalism alone to normalize relations with Israel. In closing, I would like to state for the record what I believe are the conditions which Israel must satisfy before the Islamic world or indeed, the world can willingly grant it legitimacy. Under Israeli-US pressure, the General is determined to turn Pakistan into an instrument for promoting Israeli ambitions in the Islamic world. When Islamic governments ignore these connections, and stand individually on their sickly nationalisms, they encourage and facilitate the imperialist attempts of the United States and Israel among others to subjugate these countries, to pick them off one by one. As a result, Pakistan lost the strategic depth it had created in Afghanistan though, not with the best means by handing over Afghanistan to its strategic adversaries, the Northern Alliance and India.

Bass, whose state is facing major cleanup costs, has stated that he will not vote for the final version of the energy bill if it contains an MTBE waiver, unless, that is, some sort of deal is struck to help clean up states like his. *** Regardless of whether DeLay gets the MTBE waiver passed, both the oil and gas industry and their backers in Congress surely know that it will make for bad PR if they are seen as doing nothing about cleaning up leaky tanks and MTBE-tainted water supplies. In fact, when the EPA set out to draw up a rule for gasoline additives in the late 1980s, MTBE wasnt even under consideration: The agency was planning to increase the use of renewable fuels such as methanol and ethanol, which would likely have excluded the use of MTBE. During the trial, a slew of incriminating documents and depositions forced the oil companies to admit they had deliberately kept the dangers of MTBE secret, even as they were lobbying Congress to draft laws that would increase production of fuel laden with the stuff. Even if every tank site were cleaned up today, the number of contaminated water supplies would continue to grow in the future, largely due to the vast quantities of MTBE already working their way through the ground. Without a ban on MTBE, which is the only way to prevent MTBE spills, and adequate funding for cleaning up water supplies, water utilities and their customers will still be saddled with massive costs. The problem was that more than a hundred members of Congress who favor DeLays industry MTBE waiver also hail from districts with at least some MTBE contamination, and given growing public awareness about the issue, very few of these representatives could vote for the waiver in a stand-alone vote. *** Although its true that Congress can pass whatever it has the votes to pass, one question lingers: How on earth can Tom",1,1

So investors should be happy to see that the company remains committed to continuing the buyback in 2017, already pledging to return at least 75% of its adjusted net income to investors this year. Further, as the chart on the following slide shows, the company's commitment to repurchasing shares has significantly reduced its share count since 2011: Image source: Valero Energy investor presentation. That's a move that should have investors smiling, given the company's strong financial position and the meaningful impact the buybacks are having on the company's share count. Continue Reading Below While Valero paid out all its earnings, and then some, to shareholders last year, that decision didn't have an adverse impact on the company's financial situation. Yet just because Valero has a higher return hurdle for new refinery projects, that doesn't mean it has limited its ability to grow. That's clear by looking at its 2017 capex budget, which will see the company invest $1.1 billion in growth projects, up from $600 million of growth spending last year. Valero Energy's buyback is a winner given the noticeable impact it's having on the share count. Valero's capital discipline not only doesn't diminish its growth prospects, but it also pays off in other ways, including driving its ability to deliver peer-leading returns on invested capital (ROIC).

71,"Oh really now: So, in order for hate-crime hoaxes to be ""common"" they either have to number quite a few more than 6,222 a year (when in fact the number is probably closer to 6), or Taranto has to be claiming that the vast majority of hate crimes prosecuted in this country annually are ""hoaxes."" In reality, those 6,222 hate crimes reported in 2011 by the FBI are seriously under-reported: Federal law has required states to collect hate crime data since the early 1990s. And indeed Taranto goes on to ask: Why are phony ""hate crimes"" so common, especially on college campuses? If authorities don't know how many hate crimes are committed, it's difficult to get an accurate picture of whether hate crime laws are effective. No, James Taranto, the real question is: Why are phony hate crimes such an object of fetishization by right-wing apologists, when in fact they are relatively rare? The headline, responding to the recent reports of a woman in Wyoming who perpetrated a hoax pretending to have been threatened with rape by a right-wing hater, read: 'Hate Crime' Hoaxes Why are they so common, especially on campus? The result, critics say, is a federal data system that costs $1 million-plus but offers very little help to authorities who investigate, identify and track hate crimes. ""Without accurate, nuanced reporting of these crimes, it is more difficult for federal, state, and local law enforcement to assess and respond to the particular threat that the Sikh community faces,"" the senators said last month in a letter to Holder. Can Taranto show us any more cases of phony hate-crime reports from college campuses? I'm sure the prosecutors and police who pursued those crimes and reported them to the FBI's database will be interested to know the latter, if that's the case. In states that do have UCR programs, the FBI offers training for state and local law enforcement on how to collect and report hate crime data.

Apple Inc. has incorporated more diverse emojis into the developer version of the latest update to its mobile operating system. ADVERTISEMENT Apple is adding more than 300 additional emoji, including new icons of gay families and 32 new country flags. A Unicode technical report says users worldwide want emojis that better reflect global diversity. An Apple spokeswoman said Tuesday that the company is working with the Unicode Consortium, the nonprofit organization that sets the standards for the pictograms, to update the standard so that it better represents diversity for all of us. Currently almost all the emojis depicting people or body parts, such as a fist or bicep, look white on Apple devices and other platforms. Unicode last fall proposed adding five new skin color options for emojis. Devices made by Cupertino, California-based Apple as well as those running Google Inc.s Android operating system dominate the smartphone and tablet market.

11572,"Celebrating Pete Seeger: Singer Asked People to 'Overcome'.ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) Unable to carry his beloved banjo, Pete Seeger used a different but equally formidable instrument, his voice, to instruct yet another generation of young people how to effect change through song and determination two years ago. He finally got to sing it five months later in a stirring return appearance, although one station, in Detroit, cut the songs last stanza: Now every time I read the papers/That old feelin comes on/Were waist deep in the Big Muddy/And the big fool says to push on. Every kid who ever sat around a campfire singing an old song is indebted in some way to Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie once said. Repeatedly pressed by the committee to reveal whether he had sung for Communists, Seeger responded sharply: I love my country very dearly, and I greatly resent this implication that some of the places that I have sung and some of the people that I have known, and some of my opinions, whether they are religious or philosophical, or I might be a vegetarian, make me any less of an American. Seeger and Horton were part of a group that had the song copyrighted, according to The Times, and royalties are put in a special fund, which is administered by the Highlander Research and Education Center. But with a simple gesture extending his friendship Seeger gave the protesters and even their opponents a moment of brotherhood the short-lived Occupy movement sorely needed. The now-famous song was taught to Seeger by Zilphia Horton, who directed music at the Tennessee-based Highlander Folk School, The New York Times reported. Official Washington sang along the audience must sing was the rule at a Seeger concert when it lionized him at the Kennedy Center in 1994. He performed with the great minstrel Woody Guthrie in his younger days and wrote or co-wrote If I Had a Hammer, Turn, Turn, Turn, Where Have All the Flowers Gone and Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.

And, sure enough, Morgans next guest wasRon Prosor, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. After that came CNNs Fareed Zakaria, who reiterated his previously stated defense of Israels actions: First, one has to say, Piers, as you did, the Israelis are justified in doing something when all these rockets are being fired at them. If a reporter cant answer that question with anything but Heres what the United States is saying, it might be be easier to get a government spokesperson to do just that. But it certainly seems to be the case that, of course, the United States is saying that all of this is square on the shoulders of Hamas, because of the escalations that have been happening from Gaza, especially the rocket attacks, but also attacks with anti-tank weapons on Israeli patrols in the past couple of weeks that have been ratcheted up. I mean, one of the things that is almost obsolete is to try to lay blame on anyone or to say who actually started any of this. The show wasnt entirely one-sided.

Scientists revolt against one of Europe’s most ambitious research projects.BERLIN, Germany If its true, as the saying goes, that politics in academia are especially vicious because the stakes are so low, raising the ante doesnt always seem to improve matters. The open letters signatories say thats turned the project into a computing exercise, drastically lowering its odds of teaching us much about the brain. At least thats what an ongoing revolt by researchers against one of Europes most ambitious scientific projects appears to show. Alexandre Pouget, a neuroscientist from the University of Geneva, says without contributions from both sides, it would be astounding if the project achieves its goal of building an artificial human brain within ten years. Led by Zachary Mainen, director of the Champalimaud Neuroscience Programme in Portugal, the dissenters say thats a promising sign. If it works, the method could reverse engineer a map of the brain's circuitry that would otherwise take millions of conventional experiments to achieve, he says. With $1.6 billion in funding and hundreds of researchers from across the continent, the European Union's Human Brain Project (HBP) is attempting to simulate the workings of the human brain using big data systems. But last month, more than 150 neuroscientists signed an open letter to the European Commission demanding a new, more transparent review of the project, suggesting its not on course and that its funding should be parceled out to smaller neuroscience projects as individual grants. They argue that simulations alone will never be enough to provide an understanding of how the firing of neurons translates into thoughts and feelings.

We have a lot of multigenerational employees folks whose fathers worked here, Schultz says of the firm, now at about 100 employees. There may not be a new generation of Bradburys or Stamms at the Albuquerque-based general contractor, but the firm still prides itself on being a family operation. Jim King joined the team in 1972 and, while he wasnt related to the founding family, there was a clear sense of kinship. I prepared my whole life for this, says Schultz, who succeeded her father, Jim King, as president of Bradbury Stamm Construction in 2011.

Wilson was also a member of the Defense Appropriations Committee to which bunch of self-important prats the US armed forces pay court because they need money and the best way to obtain it was (and is) to cultivate committee members, no matter how nauseating and pompous they might be.

Pakistani officers and Afghan leaders who became rich during the Wilson/CIA/Saudi years of fabulous generosity may have thought their activities discreet, but Zia knew what was going on and quietly laughed up his sleeve while continuing to fool the unbelievers.

Banda quickly announced that she would be doing things differently from Mutharika, who had alienated donor nations, especially Britain. Malawi's relations with donors have already improved thanks to Banda's actions and the British government, which had been extremely critical of Mutharika, is now urging other donors to restore funding as soon as possible.

Kroger has spent billions on lowering prices over the past decade, McMullen said in June, and the management team has ""no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices."" That price leadership is proving expensive to the business, with operating margin declining by half of a percentage point over the trailing 12 months.

Keller referred to Okrents column as one that was seared into his memory and it clearly still bothers him even today, especially when Okrent said that creationists should not expect to find comfort in the papers Science Times section. Maybe they dont do it perfectly all the time, maybe their biases creep in, but there is a discipline, there is an expectation that youreas a judge, youre supposed to set your personal biases aside So the paper may be socially liberal, in Kellers words, but because he expects reporters to set their biases aside the Times therefore isnt biased in favor of Democrats or liberals. You know, we are liberal in the sense that we are open-minded, sort of tolerant, urban, you know our weddings page includes and did even before New York had a gay marriage law, included gay unions, so were liberal in that sense of the word. Its a different question whether individual reportersI mean, there arethere are surveys that show that people who work in journalism tend to be predominantly liberal in their views of the world. That would be the ideal standard for any newspaper in the countrynot just the Timesbut the fact of the matter is that it isnt the standard practiced very often, if at all, at the Gray Lady. You know, I know that every judge sitting on the bench has some strong opinions that probably enter into his feelings about defendants and prosecutors and defense lawyers.

553,"What one British writer called the jurisprudential kernel of his thoughts is as follows: In the modern world, we must avoid the inflexible or over-restrictive applications of traditional law and must be wary of our universalist Enlightenment system, which risks ghettoizing a minority. By a nice coincidence, a London think tank called the Center for Social Cohesion issued a report just days before the leader of the worlds Anglicans and Episcopalians capitulated to Islamic demands. His reasoning, if one may call it that, is clear: Other faiths already have their own legal authorities, so why not the Muslims, too? Certainly, it is true that, since last Thursday, when Rowan Williamsthe archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Church of England, symbolic leader of the international Anglican Churchcalled for constructive accommodation with some aspects of sharia law and declared the incorporation of Muslim religious law into the British legal system unavoidable, practically no insult has been left unsaid. This, in other words, was no pleasant fluff about tolerance for foreigners: This was a call for the evisceration of the British legal system as we know it. This same argument has been used already, and will be used again, to demand that laws governing blasphemy, originally written to protect only Christians from being upset, should now, in a nondiscriminatory way, be amended to cover Muslims as well. The alternativedont have any blasphemy laws and let religious peoples feelings be hurt, just as the feelings of the secular are regularly offended by religiondoesnt occur to the archbishop and people who think like him. If that phrase is even intended to mean anything, it can only imply that a concession of this kind would lessen the propensity to violence among Muslims. Of course, Christopher Hitchens summed up the proper response most robustly, To Hell With the Archbishop of Canterbury.

7008,"While the current analysis didnt examine the outcomes of giving cancer survivors too many or too few tests, it offers fresh evidence that patients may often want more testing than doctors should do based on current treatment guidelines. As cancer increasingly becomes a chronic disease instead of a death sentence, doctors and patients are struggling to strike the right balance between doing enough follow-up tests to catch any new tumors quickly and avoiding too many needless tests that can lead to unnecessary interventions that dont help people live longer. Cancer Survivors Seek Unneeded Tests for Reassurance.#160;Many people who survive cancer fear recurrence after their treatment ends, according to a study that suggests these concerns may lead to unnecessary tests. Guidelines for follow-up tests depend on many factors including the type of cancer, how advanced it was when it was first detected and treated, and individual patient characteristics like age and other health problems. Data from 12 previously published studies involving 849 patients show that after completing treatment, patients want as many follow-up exams and tests as possible to reassure them that tumors have not returned, researchers found. Even so, the findings suggest that doctors and patients may need to have more-frank conversations about how follow-up tests can help and when extensive testing may do more harm than good. Patients should understand how many recurrent cancers are typically detected with a specific test and how often they might get whats known as a false-positive result, when the test result suggests that tumors have returned even though thats not the case, de Bock said. The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed to test how or if patients preferences about follow-up care influence treatment for cancer survivors. For example, some patients said the process of getting more tests and waiting for the results made them anxious, but some patients also said they wanted to continue with a lifetime of extensive follow-up testing. False negatives, when people with new tumors think theyre cancer-free, are also possible. Patients often said they had lost confidence in their body and feared recurrence so much that they requested screenings that they understood might not be needed. Cancer sur",0,4

Rimonabant has also been successfully tested as an aid to quitting smoking and might even be useful in treating alcoholism and other addictions No wonder many industry analysts are backing it to become the first blockbuster drug of the 21st century All four obesity trials are now complete. Sanofi-Aventis, the worlds third-largest drug company, is pursuing a similar strategy as it seeks approval to market a drug called Acomplia to treat a condition called metabolic syndrome. Curiously, however, Sanofi-Aventis does not intend to market rimonabant for weight-loss or smoking cessation, preferring to cast it as a heart medication on the back of the cardiovascular benefits of curbing metabolic syndrome and giving up cigarettes.

Yesterday, I read about U.S. aviation brigades training in Colorados Fort Carson for possible Afghan deployment: 2,000 troops, part of an exercise called Eagle Strike, are preparing for attacks with ground-pounding weapons.

LONDON (Reuters) - British consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica lies at the center of a storm for using data obtained from millions of Facebook users without their permission after it was hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. Analysts said U.S. companies like Boeing, as well as deals which require Chinese approval, could also become caught in the crossfire should a trade war break out. Beijing was bracing on Thursday for an announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump of tariffs of as much as $60 billion on Chinese imports, raising fears that the two countries could be sliding towards a trade war.

These have come not just from the more bullying precincts of Trump fandom, as in Get on the Trump train or get run over, but also from party regulars and office holders suggesting that failure to endorse Trump now is a kind of stubborn self-indulgence. That said, Hillary Clinton may well be the only major political figure in the country who could possibly lose a general election to Donald Trump. If she attempts to reprise or even exceed the many arrogations of power Obama has attempted, Republicans will block her as best they can. On the third hand, an analysis by Political Machination suggests that while Trump did bring out some new voters in the primaries, the newly#160;minted Trump Republicans were too few in the states examined to make up the 2012 Romney deficit. Yes, if there is a binary choice (not completely clear as of this writing) between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, it is possible that voters in swing states who decline to support Trump may be assisting Clinton. Some of Trumps supporters are exulting at recent polls showing a slight Trump lead, while scorning those who advised as recently as a few weeks ago that a Trump nomination could lead the Republican party to a Goldwater-type debacle. Some Never Trump voters may have to live with that miserable outcome rather than violate their consciences by voting for an authoritarian ignoramus. So remaining Never Trump is not disloyal its the only way to safeguard conservative principles. But one of the points the Never Trump people have stressed is that there were two equally painful possible outcomes of a Trump nomination: He loses or he wins. In fact, as two political scientists argue in the New York Times, Bernie Sanderss support seems to come chiefly not from socialist young people but from disaffected white men. The past few days have featured hectoring demands of Never Trump people to get over it.",0,4

As well as drawing local tourists, a handful of foreigners make pilgrimages to see the site where General MacArthur brought his forces ashore in 1944 to liberate the Philippines from its Japanese occupiers. But ask a local resident for directions to the village and there comes the first hint of what makes it so unusual, even amid the widespread carnage of Typhoon Haiyan. Mrs Miraflorez spoke to The Sunday Telegraph as she picked among the rubble of her own house, where all that was left standing was the lavatory - its base inscribed with ""April 2007"", the date their home was built - and her husband's welding machine.

Court hears discrimination case over wedding cake..................................................................................................................................................................................... At issue in the complaint from David Mullins and Charlie Craig against Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver is whether religious freedom can protect a business from discrimination allegations from gay couples. Mullins and Craig wanted to buy a cake last year, but when one of the shop owners, Jack Phillips, found out the cake was to celebrate a gay wedding, he turned the couple of away and cited his religious faith. She said Phillips faces fines if the court rules against him and he continues to refuse to make wedding cakes for gay couples. ADVERTISEMENT Phillips attorney, Nicolle Martin, said her client shouldnt be forced to ignore his Christian faith while running the business hes had for nearly 40 years. In New Mexico, the state Supreme Court ruled in August that an Albuquerque business was wrong to decline to photograph a same-sex couples commitment ceremony. Martin has said the case is about religious conscience and that one persons beliefs shouldnt be held above someone elses. A similar case is pending in Washington state, where a florist is accused of refusing service for a same-sex wedding. Here, the discrimination was based on who the customers were, and thats what Colorado clearly prohibits, Goad said. The civil union law, which passed earlier this year, does not provide religious protections for businesses a provision Republicans wanted. Democrats argued that such a provision would give businesses cover to discriminate in violation of state law.

2394,"The first major post-inauguration evidence that Trump is just a typical political con man came in February with a raid in Yemen resulting in the murder of an 8-year-old American girl and dozens of other civilians by US Navy Seals (one of whom also died). Perhaps Trump will change course yet again and start pulling American troops out of the Middle East when (not if) things blow up in his face, as Ronald Reagan did after the 1983 Beirut Marine barracks bombing. On the other hand, he called for rebuilding the US armed forces, which hardly need it (theyre already the most expensive and bloated war machine on the planet). Photo by Marcel Trindade CC BY 2.0 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump claimed to have opposed the Iraq war, wanted better relations with Russia, and even briefly put his hand on the hot stove of the Arab-Israeli conflict, calling himself neutral on Palestine. Apart from a few bitter-enders still trying and failing to get the words I was wrong out of their mouths like Fonzie in Happy Days, antiwar Trump supporters seem to understand that they got played. And he yanked his hand off the stove when he got his fingers burnt, turning 180 degrees to announce that hed be the most pro-Israel president ever, when he decided thats what it took to win the election. Some antiwar activists took heart at the possibility that he might, as president, cut back on US military adventurism. Now hes deployed 400 artillery and infantry troops from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit and 100 US Army Rangers to Syria, effectively doubling the number of US military boots on the ground there. Mainstream American media outlets seem to consider it novel, perhaps even controversial, that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad refers to the US troops as invaders. Sorry, Non-Interventionists: Donald Trump is a War President. His temperament and, so far, his actions scream war president.

[emphasis added] In 1985, the leading rabbi of the American conservative Jewish movement also used the phrase ""peace in our time"" while discussing potential arms talks between Reagan and Soviet premiere Mikhail Gorbachev. Fox contributors Jonah Goldberg, Charles Krauthammer, and John Bolton seized on Obama's use of the words ""peace in our time,"" claiming that Obama's use of the term recalled former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, who used a similar phrase in 1938 when he announced that he had made a deal with Adolf Hitler to allow Nazi Germany to take over part of Czechoslovakia without firing a shot. In a 1983 speech at a presentation ceremony for the Peace Corps Awards, Reagan said: I am very pleased to honor these six fine Americans who have volunteered their time, skills, and experience to the cause of peace. Obama explained that we must do this ""not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes:#160; tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.""

This advantage has helped Tencent rise to the top of the video game industry, with the company standing as the world's largest publisher by revenue and possessing a selection of franchise properties, development resources, and social media integration that position it to take advantage of ongoing growth in interactive entertainment. The tech giant has also built one of China's most successful video-streaming platforms -- an asset that adds to the theme of beneficial synergies between its products. Big expectations are factored into Tencent's stock price, with shares trading at 62 times trailing earnings and 18 times trailing sales, but the company has built a series of competitive advantages that position it to thrive over the long term.

Republicans put the number at several hundred billion, but they are suddenly shifting the terms of debate, including about whether lower interest costs should be counted, as they have been, as part of spending cuts. This would have been more persuasive if the time necessary to ping-pong such a deal back and forth between the two houses wasnt at least as long as the time necessary for approving a deal negotiated by the president and the speaker. ADVERTISEMENT Before the non-vote, congressional Republicans insisted that Boehner was forced to switch course because the two sides were further apart than the White House asserted. Which is exactly what happened Thursday night, when Boehner was forced to call off a scheduled House vote on his plan because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass. A plan that raises taxes (Republican anathema), fails to cut spending (Republican dogma) and does not avert a noxious (especially to Republicans) part of the cliff, the sequester of defense spending. In the meantime, Republicans said, they were obligated to come up with a solution to avert tax hikes on the vast majority of Americans. If and, as is looking increasingly likely, when the country hurtles over the fiscal cliff, it will be in part because the House speaker abruptly decided to upend negotiations with the White House. Or perhaps, and this may be the most likely after Plan Bs failure, he, once again, cannot produce the votes for the grand-enough bargain. Perhaps he felt he needed to convince reluctant Republicans that the deal he was cooking up with the president is the best that can be achieved.

8674,"Introducing the term, Thomas argues, was unnecessary: the presiding justices themselves had already noted that all landowners have the right to a proportionate share of the water, and Justice Peckham had declared the condemnation was concededly for a direct public use. The Supreme Courts 5-4 ruling in Kelothat economic development is sufficient justification to invoke eminent domain rests on a long history of court cases in which the definition of public use has been something along the lines of public benefit. Thomas argues that if the framers had really intended the powers of eminent domain to be used for public benefit rather than public use, they would have said so. Thomas also contends that another common practice, that of deferring decisions of what justifies public use to legislators, is ultimately baseless as well. With obvious distaste, he concludes: The court relies almost exclusively on this Courts prior cases to derive todays far reaching, and dangerous result but the principles this Court should employ to dispose of this case are found in the Public Use Clause itself, not in Justice Peckhams high opinion of reclamation laws When faced with a clash of constitutional principles and a line of unreasoned cases, wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitutions original meaning.

5993,"Here's how the Washington Post gleefully frames it: The bill would revolutionize Americas health-care system, replacing it with a public system that would be paid for by higher taxes. As noted by National Interest, the only way our government overlords can adequately impose stringent budgets on something as elusive as healthcare is to essentially create cost controls in the ""form of old-fashioned price controls or periodic payment cuts to doctors, hospitals or other medical professionals."" ""Individuals and families earning over $250,000 would face a 40 percent increase in taxes to finance the plan and pay for most of the new costs of the plan."" Employer-provided health care would be replaced, with the employers paying higher taxes but no longer on the hook for insurance. Once considered a fringe socialist crazy with no chance of gaining ground in the Democratic Party, the populist socialist Bernie Sanders has introduced a single-payer "" Medicare For All"" health care bill that has been endorsed by 15 senators, meaning it may create a possible litmus test for candidates hoping to gain the nomination in 2020. The ""Medicare For All Act Of 2017"" would essentially eliminate private insurance for most Americans and impose higher taxes. Here's a helpful tip: anytime a politician says ""free,"" just immediately add a few percentages to your tax bracket, which would definitely be the case in Bernie's plan, which calls for a 7.5% payroll tax on employers and a 4% income-based premium on all Americans. Sanders made a similar, albeit much more modest, proposal of 6.2% payroll tax increase last year, and according to a 2016 analysis of that proposal by Emory University Professor Kenneth Thorpe, the payroll tax would reduce wages. That means the projected cost does not match the revenue stream, which in turn will require higher taxes than Bernie's 7.2% payroll tax. ""Cost control through budgetary limitations or medical-payment cuts typically reduces the access that patients have to treatment, starting with progressively longer waiting lists."" Low-income working families would pay 2.2 percent of taxable income and face a 6.2 percent reduction in wages traced to the employer pay",1,3

The Republican Party, particularly if it hopes to be successful at the presidential level, needs to take these shifts into account. And it means choosing a person to represent the party who, when saying our best days are ahead of us, is actually believableand who inspires confidence in skeptics rather than simply inciting passion in supporters.

Fava said the new IRS limit will hinder some taxpayers looking to make changes to multiple IRA accounts next year. Under IRS rules, you have a 60-day period during which you can take your money out of one IRA account and put it in another account, before you have to pay taxes on that money. Continue Reading Below Starting in January 2015, individuals will be allowed only one tax-free IRA rollover during a one-year period. Previously, individuals could do one rollover per IRA account per year; if the taxpayer had four IRA accounts, he could do one tax-free rollover for each account. Advertisement But Fava said some individuals use tax-free IRA rollovers as a type of short-term loan. Its also fairly common to consolidate multiple IRA accounts, simplifying a taxpayers financial big picture. Rather than withdrawing an IRA account and receiving a check, which is later sent to a different management company, taxpayers can arrange for their management company to directly send the money to the another company. Now, each individual will get only one tax-free rollover a year, regardless of how many accounts he has. As long as you end up putting the full amount back in a new IRA account within the 60-day period, theres no penalty. There is one loophole, however, that will allow taxpayers to make multiple tax-free rollovers, by arranging for a trustee-to-trustee transfer. Karl Fava, CPA, said rollovers are most common when an accountholder wants to change management companies, switching their IRA savings, for example, from, lets say, a Charles Schwab account to a Fidelity account.",1,3

Therefore he refuses to encourage Israel in any way to eliminate its nuclear weapons and delivery capabilities, or even to talk about the matter.

Now theres action all around with thousands of bats unspooling into four great ribbons to fly through this gauntlet of Swainsons hawks. Erecting thousands of wind turbines along a major migration corridor would seemingly fail a fundamental requirement for bird-safe wind energy: correct siting. Seven wind farms have been built in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, near a stretch of the flyway used by the vast majority of Swainsons hawks. The project would be relatively small at just 50 turbines on about 3,000 acres, but it can only ratchet up the pressure on this threatened, distinctive population of Swainsons hawk. Several wind farms comprising more than 700 turbines have already been constructed in the Montezuma Hills of Solano County, an important part of the Swainsons hawks historic breeding range. Turning my binoculars toward the distant lead bats, now far out over the valley, I wonder how much longer this remarkable hunt can last. When a farmer drives his pickup out of a field and stops to lock a gate, I walk over and ask whether hes seen any hawks or bats in the neighborhood. A World Bank document about one of the Tehuantepec wind farms states that avian impacts are not expected to be significant, but a case study of another wind farm admits concern about the potential cumulative impacts of the many additional wind farms planned in the same general area. The hawks gather when its time for the bats to emerge, and well hear them, he assures me.

However, though Judge Urbinas ruling keeps Utahs public lands safe pending a decision by the Obama administration, it doesnt help the land in five other states that have also been slated for increased drilling by the Bush administration. Made official in mid-December, the move would have given oil and gas companies the right to begin drilling in sensitive riparian areas and key wildlife corridors throughout Utah. As we wrote in our September/October 2008 issue, environmentalists say the recent attempts to free up public lands for oil and gas companies were parting gifts to the energy industry by Bushs Interior Department. In his decision this weekend, Judge Ricardo Urbina found that the groups logic held, and that any energy development would be far outweighed by the public interest in avoiding irreparable damage to public lands and the environment. Several environmental groups, including the NRDC and Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, filed suit against the government to stop the Interior Department from leasing the lands.

The growing divide is reportedly rooted on generational gaps in terms of management and leadership styles and principles between the old man Rupert Murdoch on one hand, and his sons James and Lachlan Murdoch on the other. There's the battle on the issues that hounded Ailes and O' Reilly that Fox seemed to have conceded, but apparently the real, tougher war is raging within the Murdoch family.

2695,"Dear Credit Card Adviser, Continue Reading Below Is it true that if you make two credit card payments in a month, only the first one can be used toward the interest payment? There is one exception to the CARD Act's excess payment rule: If you buy something under a delayed interest plan -- such as ""no interest if paid in full in six months"" offer -- then you can choose to apply your excess payment to that balance instead of the balance with the highest interest rate, so you can take advantage of the deferred interest. Heres an example: Hypothetical credit card balance Cash advance balance: $500 with a 20% rate Balance transfer balance: $200 with a 17% rate New purchase balance: $300 with a 15% rate Total credit card balance: $1,000 Any payment amount left over after the minimum payment is applied must go toward the $500 balance from the cash advance because it has the highest interest rate. Before, credit card companies would apply any amount past the minimum payment to the balance with the lowest interest rate. The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 made significant changes to how issuers can apply credit card payments to the consumer's advantage. This happens when one credit card has different annual percentage rates, or APRs, for different types of transactions, such as new purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. The balance includes the principal (how much you charged, took out as a cash advance or transferred to the card) and the interest accrued that month based on the principal and any fees. Otherwise, the credit card company is required to apply the two payments before the delayed interest period ends to the delayed interest balance, in their entirety. You cannot pay just the interest, and typically issuers don't allow you to pay ahead on credit cards like they do with installment loans. The minimum payment itself typically goes to the balance with the lowest interest rate, because issuers want to make as much money off of the higher interest rates as possible. So, how do you have more than one interest rate on the same credit card? If you think your credit card company is not applying your credit card payments correctly, contact them first to log your complaint.",1,3

As President Donald Trump remained out of sight and silent, pressure mounted from both sides of the aisle for him to explicitly condemn white supremacists and hate groups involved in deadly, race-fueled clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia. His attorney general, Jeff Sessions, vigorously defended Trump in nationally televised interviews Monday morning and said he expects to hear more from the commander-in-chief on the matter. Trump, as a presidential candidate, frequently came under scrutiny for being slow to offer his condemnation of white supremacists.

Not only did hedge funders write some big checks, Stone and Isikoff found, they also held multiple fundraisers and coordinated strategy to direct what appear to be unprecedented sums into the coffers of GOP and allied political committees. And in 2009, 98 percent of donations from the top ten hedge fund managers went to Democrats.#160; But, as Peter Stone and Michael Isikoff report on Wednesday, the love is gone between Wall Streets high fliers and the Democratic Party. To illustrate just how much influence Wall Street can have on an election, Stone and Isikoff point to the reelection of Rep. Scott Garrett (R-NJ): As it became increasingly clear late last summer that Republicans were likely to capture the House, the partners at Elliott Management Corp., a $17 billion Wall Street hedge fund that specializes in distressed foreign debt, mobilized to boost Garretts political fortunes. That bill, which the GOP also fought again,#160;is largely the reason the Democrats ties to big finance have frayed in the past year. Theres been no shortage of public anger at Wall Street over issues like undercutting financial reform, six- and-seven figure bonuses during the recession, and the taxpayer-funded bailouts of the nations largest banks. The finance, insurance, and real estate, or FIRE, sector gave $10 million more to Democratic presidential candidates in 2008 than their GOP counterparts. Of that amount, $45,000 was donated by nine Elliott executives to the congressmans leadership political action committee Supporting Conservatives of Today and Tomorrow. According to campaign finance data, a clutch of wealthy hedge funds injected $10 million into Republican campaign committees in the run-up to the midterm elections in November.

The New Mexico True Certified Program allows businesses that grow, raise and manufacture products in the state to use the ""certified"" brand on their packaging and marketing materials. Latham said the state is not currently able to help individual businesses cover costs but does have strategies for helping companies implement the brand without significant expense. While the state describes the program as free, Lock said it would likely cost as much as $25,000 in new plates to incorporate the brand on his 10 different beer cans.

The agency has said it expects to decide whether to charge Barclays and former executives early next year in its criminal inquiry into the bank's financial arrangements with Qatar, that included a Barclays' loan to the Gulf state. The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is pressing for a civil lawsuit against Barclays by former senior investment banker Richard Boath to be heard in private to avoid prejudicing its investigation into the bank's 2008 emergency fundraising. Advertisement Barclays' emergency fundraising, which allowed the bank to become one of the few British lenders to sidestep a state bailout, has also triggered a separate civil lawsuit by businesswoman Amanda Staveley. The SFO said it had applied to the East London Employment Tribunal to either impose privacy on the proceedings or to ensure that Boath and Barclays' legal representatives do not refer to the contents of an SFO interview with Boath in open court when the case kicks off in earnest next week. Staveley, who put together a syndicate of Abu Dhabi investors in October 2008, has alleged in court documents that Barclays made an undisclosed $3 billion loan to Qatar shortly before completion of the October 2008 capital raising. That case, which is due to come to trial in January 2018 if it is not settled, hinges on the terms that Qatari and Abu Dhabi investors received for participating in a cash call by Barclays to raise around 7 billion pounds in 2008. Sources familiar with the matter have said Boath, who was co-head of global finance in EMEA at the time of the capital raising, has been interviewed alongside former chief executives Bob Diamond and John Varley, former finance director Chris Lucas and former tax advisory boss Roger Jenkins among others.

The audience at a performance of Julius Caesar would know that the only people who could possibly avoid the tragic end are Caesar, Brutus and Cassius themselves, but they also know that none of those individuals will (as a matter of fact) alter their behavior and so avert their respective fates. What they cannot know is that there is a clear boundary separating what happens on the stage and what happens everywhere else, because in the age of Trump, it is clear that tragedy and comedy and farce have merged and become one, and in that merger of genres the theatrical has left the stage and entered irreversibly into our world. Furthermore, if everything I do and say and think is news instantly reported and published to the world in my Twitter or Facebook feed and monitored and collected and recorded by the U.S. government it follows that nothing, no aspect of or occurrence in my life belongs to me and not equally and simultaneously to you and to everyone else.

I am saying that those liberals who mock her ignorance are implicitly claiming to know something that they cannot know. Could it be that once again the Trumpsters know something that the liberal establishment cannot acknowledge? For just as Ms. Loomer was apparently unable to distinguish between Julius Caesar Roman Emperor on stage and Donald Trump the U.S. President, so we ourselves have no way of determining whether Loomer herself was acting or not whether she was motivated by genuine concern for her country or by a desire to post a live video and increase",1,1

Thats why George Bush could let it be known, two days before Christmas, that contributions to global food aid programs will be cut. Commenting on the report, Florence Chenoweth, the food and agriculture agency representative pointed out that hunger kills one child every five seconds. A report issued two days earlier by the U.N. food and agriculture agency disclosed that 852 million people (or almost three times the number of people living in the United States) suffered chronic malnutrition and five million children a year die because of malnutrition. It said that over one-half of all the children in the world or more than one billion children suffer extreme deprivation because of war, HIV. It observed that each year the equivalent of the entire population of children under five living in France, Germany, Greece and Italy died from deaths that could have been prevented. Cutting back on food aid is a good way of reducing spending without impacting the wealthy whose pleas for help are heard and heeded. The report says 45 million children will die by 2015 because the wealthy are not living up to the promises of support they made many years ago. If you add the 5 million children from the Unicef report to the equation every 2 seconds a child dies from mostly preventable causes. In the interview he observed that the military receive $900 billion each year from world governments and wealthy farmers receive $300 billion.

But Apple has built a tightly woven ecosystem of platforms, developers, and product and service synergies that make it hard and costly for users to switch while raising competitive barriers more effectively than patents alone. Apple is the most powerful brand in the world because its primary focus is on customer experience with its products and services. Looking back on it, when Apple launched the Think Different ad campaign in 1997, it didnt just mark the return of Steve Jobs, a new philosophy to reignite a beat-down culture, or the beginning of the greatest turnaround in corporate history. Proponents of Web 2.0 the open source platform that brought us social media and user generated content would have us believe the world is better off as one big happy collective of worker drones.

In PBS One Last Thing documentary, Steve Jobs said (Im doing a bit of editing here for clarity), The minute you understand you can poke life if you push in, something will pop out the other side that you can change it, you can mold it, thats maybe the most important thing. Apple brought back vertical integration in a big way. Jobs said they created iTunes because they all love music and thought it would be great to buy online.

Essebsi's Nidaa Tounes party reached a deal with the Islamist Ennahda party to overcome a crisis triggered by the murder of two secular leaders last year.

Ennahda stepped down at the start of this year to make way for a technocrat transitional cabinet until elections.

But while the usefulness of systemic thinking in policy-making has been demonstrated in a large number of empirical settings, we still lack a detailed understanding of the dynamics at play when policy makers address systemic problems. Compulsive Policy-making—The Evolution of the German Feed-in Tariff System for Solar Photovoltaic Power.Journal Article - Research Policy In recent years, policy approaches that build upon the notion of innovation systems have enjoyed increasing attention in science, technology and innovation policy. We argue that the pattern of policy serving as both a solution to and a driver of technological bottlenecks shows strong similarities with what Rosenberg (1969) called 'compulsivesequences' in the development of technical systems. In this paper, we show how complex interdependencies and the uncertain nature of technological change shape the process of targeted policy interventions in socio-technical systems. We find that the policy has been subject to a considerable amount of changes, many of which are the result of policy makers addressing specific system issues and bottlenecks. Interestingly, however, often these issues themselves were driven by unforeseen technological developments induced by previous policy interventions. Toward this end we analyzed the evolution of the German feed-in tariff (FIT) system for solar photovoltaic power, a highly effective and widely copied policy instrument targeted at fostering the diffusion and development of renewable energy technologies.",0,0

American Apparel had insisted in the weeks leading up to its bankruptcy and auction that any deal would keep its manufacturing plants in the United States. Garry Bell, a Gildan spokesman, said the company would decide where to make the clothing when it completes its integration plan.

They all maintained that they had only one enemy the Chinese government and explained that they had ended up at the settlement either in the hope of finding a way of rising up against their oppressors, which was unlikely, as the settlement was dirt-poor and had only one gun, or because they had hoped to travel to other countries in search of work primarily Turkey, which has historic connections to the people of East Turkestan (as the Uighurs call their homeland) but had been thwarted in their aims. In May 2006, five of the 22 were freed from Guantnamo, after being cleared in a military review, and sent to live in a refugee camp in Albania, the only country that could be persuaded to accept them after the US authorities acknowledged that they would not return them to China, where they faced the risk of torture.

The photo dovetailed into the popular story about the curse: Sianis, hoping to bring the Cubs luck, showed up to the game with Murphy, with the goat even sporting a We Got Detroits Goat blanket on his back. ADVERTISEMENT I just assumed he was one of 20, 30 guys saying, No, you cant come in with that goat,' said Logan, 73. As the Cubs plummeted in the standings over the next few years, reporters asked Sianis if hed put some sort of curse on the team. A few years after his father died in 2001, Logans cousin spotted a newspaper photograph of a lone usher standing between William Sianis and Murphy the goat at a Wrigley turnstile, and called to say he thought the usher was his dad. Even more amazing, once inside and Hartig said there is a photo of this Sianis and Murphy somehow got onto the field to stroll among the players warming up for the game. But, like many Cubs fans wistfully remembering the loved ones who died without ever seeing the team win it all, he finds himself thinking about his parents and siblings hes lost. He said as long as they dont let the goat in, they will never win the World Series, Bill Sianis said. Merullo said his dad didnt talk about the curse much, but he suspects he thought there was something to it. The memories of those three men are about a real event that has turned into an enduring tale that has only grown taller throughout the years one that may not explain why the Cubs are returning only now to the World Series after 71 years, but one that does get at what it means to be a fan of a team with",0,0

The law was passed last year by Puerto Rico lawmakers, in hope that it would help the struggling utility companies meet their debt obligations to bond holders and creditors. Padilla told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that day that Puerto Rico is running out of cash, and that future payments were unlikely. Padilla told officials that his statements were a distress call, in hopes that Congress would help the Puerto Rico government. Alejandro Garcia Padilla stated that Puerto Ricos public debt was unable to be paid back, and that concessions would be sought from debtors. Puerto Rico feels that there are no federal laws that prevent them from restructuring debt. While an explanation for his absence has not been given, the justice does own at least $15,000 in tax-free fund shares, that are invested into Puerto Rico bonds. Puerto Rico has struggled with economic issues for over nine years and holds over $72 million in public debt. Puerto Rico avoided default Dec. 1 after announcing a $355 million bond payment. The governor hopes that Congress will be able to help design a legal framework that would give the commonwealth the ability to restructure its debts.

A Congressional investigations subcommittee plans to widen its probe of the Libor interest rate scandal to include U.S. banks, its chairman said. Geithner was president of the FRBNY in 2007 when, documents indicate, it may have first learned of possible Libor manipulation by Barclays and other banks. Trillions of dollars of mortgages, credit cards, student loans and other loans are based on Libor, an interest rate set each day by more than a dozen U.S. and foreign banks. The full House and Senate committees plan to question Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the Libor scandal next week at hearings on financial regulation. In 2008, the FRBNY reported possible LIBOR problems to Fed officials in Washington, the U.S. Treasury and other regulators. The full House Financial Services Committee has not scheduled a specific hearing on Libor price fixing; neither has the Senate Banking Committee. Last week, Neugebauer demanded and received background documents from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) relating to its knowledge and handling of manipulation of Libor by Barclays bank of London. In his testimony this week, Bernanke noted Libor is regulated by British authorities, not American. Whether the FRBNY or any other U.S. regulator took any steps with the three U.S. banks that help set Libor is unclear.

The right immediately labeled the attacks yet another example of Islamic extremism on the march, linking them with the Manchester terror attack. The left believes that human beings are inherently good, and that only environment defines whether they will act in evil fashion. But it's requiring a greater and greater strain these days to blame anybody but individual human beings in free Western societies for their own descent into evil. That's also why the left argues we shouldn't hold people responsible for their actions as a general rule; instead, we should reshape society. Conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic complained about leftist multiculturalism creating room for Islamic terror growth.

NOTES: T Marcus Gilbert, who missed five games in the first half of the season with a nagging hamstring injury, returned to practice Monday and is hopeful he can play against the Colts. In the other six games, the Steelers have been quite stingy against the run, including a strong performance against the leagues leading rusher Kareem Hunt, who could manage just 21 yards on nine carries against them. The Steelers need those types of dominating performances in the second half of the season because they are vulnerable when teams have success in the run game. Colts starter Andrew Luck was placed on injured reserve last week, and the Steelers will face Jacoby Brissett instead. One of the reasons for the goal-line success has been the ability of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to get the Steelers into the right plays. There is some reason for concern after Matt Stafford threw for 423 yards against them in their last outing, but even in that game there were positives to note. On one of them, Stafford tried to pass his way in twice from the 1-yard line, and the Steelers forced an incompletion and then sacked him on fourth down.

Hateful conduct has no place on Twitter and we will continue to tackle this issue head on alongside our partners in industry and civil society, Karen White, Twitters Head of Public Policy, said in the press release. The recent terror attacks have reminded us of the urgent need to address illegal online hate speech, Jourova said in a press release. Free speech laws are generally more regulated in European countries compared to the U.S. People have been handed fines, and in some cases short jail terms, for using insulting language against certain demographics on social media. As defined in the European Unions code of conduct, illegal hate speech refers to certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law and national laws transposing it, means all conduct publicly inciting to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race, color, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. The other part is to crank down on terrorist recruitment, which doesnt necessarily overlap with direct hate speech. However, there is a clear distinction between freedom of expression and conduct that incites violence and hate. Twitter and Facebook both said they were pleased with the code of conduct, and they vow to promote independent counter narratives. The major internet companies will now put a greater effort into tracking down and reporting users to authorities. They also urge their users to report any language they find suspicious. The main part is to combat certain language on the websites. We remain committed to letting the Tweets flow.",1,3

But even well-trained caregivers can have a hard time breaking through to people whose memories are shrouded by dementia, Newton-Small said. I was like, Youre never going to have time to read 20 pages on each patient, said Newton-Small, a Washington resident who was a reporter for Time magazine. So, at the risk of the staff thinking she was weird, she offered to use her professional skills to write her fathers story for them including the bit about how he was once a part-time driver for Winston Churchill and how he liked to amble around the cypress trees and lavender fields in the south of France, where he had a country home. Having professional journalists write the profiles is crucial, Newton-Small said, adding that when that task is left to the families, some are well-written, but the vast majority are terribly written, and families take months and months to fill them out. Knowing personal details of her fathers life helped his caregivers understand trigger points that could upset him and references that might please him. In several cases, caregivers see a different version from family members, who may not want to be reminded that Aunt Sally recoils at the mention of Uncle Joe. The experience was so powerful that Newton-Small began compiling stories for others, first as a favor to friends and then as a start-up business that provides memory care facilities with online profiles that comprise personal anecdotes, photos, videos and recordings of favorite songs. Once they did, some of her behaviors, like trying to organize things, started to fall into place for them, said Sharon Daly, her sister. Bev Albert, a Chicago resident whose mother Junes profile was added to the site earlier this year, said it had allowed her caregivers to see past the cantankerousness that dementia had brought on.",0,0

A statement from Hensarling emailed after bank backers had already obtained enough signatures warned Republican colleagues that the fight would further inflame tensions inside the GOP and set a bad precedent in which a small minority of lawmakers could wrest control of the agenda from party leaders. The bank's charter expired June 30, and it has been unable to approve new applications to help overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. products like airplanes and heavy equipment. Republicans supporting the bank lined up on the House floor early Friday morning to sign on, said Rep. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., who help organize the effort. The development came as bank supporters got a majority of the House to sign a petition to dislodge a measure to revive it from a powerful panel controlled by a bank opponent. ""The Export-Import Bank plays a key role in protecting and growing American jobs by helping U.S. businesses compete on a level playing field with our foreign competitors,"" said Rep. Bob Dold, R-Ill., who signed the petition. McConnell's office has made clear that he won't bring up the House bill to give it a stand-alone vote that would send it to President Barack Obama. And any effort to try to get it through by attaching the bill to unrelated, must-pass legislation would require the assent of McConnell and House GOP leaders.

Blaming only Hamas for starting the war, sustaining it, tossing largely ineffective rockets at Israel, breaking cease-fire agreements, bringing about the deaths of Palestinians by Israeli forces, using human shields, and any other accusation that sticks, is akin to blaming the ANC for daring to resist apartheid. Like South Africa's Apartheid, Israeli Occupation Will End -- It Is Only a Matter of Time.The temporary end to the bombing of Gaza has enabled Palestinian residents to slowly return to normal. When asked to comment on the Palestinian death toll, Rivers blames Palestinians for electing Hamas to represent them, saying, You cant get rid of Hamas. If international law is impotent to hold Israel accountable, and if U.S. officials continue to unequivocally support Israel, what will end the suffering of Palestinians? Rivers also echoes the naked racism being openly embraced by certain supporters of Israel in recent weeks (read my earlier column about Israeli racism here). The United Nations has already convened a panel to investigate allegations of war crimes in Gaza by Israel (and also by Hamas), especially given that several U.N. shelters and facilities housing refugees were hit during Operation Protective Edge. No other state could get away with this but Israel can because it has the superpower United States as its primary patron. As part of its negotiations with Palestinian factions in Egypt, Israel wants a complete disarmament of Hamas, the militant political organization that has become the lynchpin of Israeli claims about self-defense. As Gazas residents return to the rubble of what was once their homes and villages, they may have a strong legal case to take Israel to the International Criminal Court for possible human rights violations and war crimes. Erakat confirmed this, saying, International laws give a people under occupation the right",1,1

Truvada has shown to be helpful for people at high risk of HIV, and it can even help when the dose is skipped sometimes. Stunning find: New HIV drug cuts infection by 86 percent in healthy gay men.Gay men who take pills used to treat HIV infection before and after risky sex can dramatically cut their risk of contracting the virus, a groundbreaking new study has found. Truvada, which is Gilead Sciences trademark of Tenofovir/emtricitabine, used a fixed-dose combination of two drugs used to treat HIV. It shows that men who didnt have HIV were 86 percent less likely to get it than men who took dummy pills. HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, is a lentivirus that leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which is when there is a progressive failure of the immune system, allowing infections and cancers to thrive unchecked in the body. AIDS typically begins with influenza-like symptoms, followed by a long period without any symptoms. The infection progresses within the body unnoticed oftentimes, compromising the immune system and leading to infections that typically dont cause large problems for people with properly functioning immune systems. The study was performed in France and Canada and tests on demand Truvada for the first time. The Food and Drug Administration approved usage of the drug in July 2012. It includes some rare side effects, including nausea, dizziness, and loss of appetite. Dr. Scott Hammer, an AIDS specialist at Columbia University, said he was impressed by the response to the drug.",0,2

Dear Tax Talk, I took a one-time first-time home buyer disbursement of $10,000 from my 403(b) retirement plan. You will owe taxes on the entire $12,500 and the 10% additional tax penalty will also be owed on the $2,500 if you meet the requirements for a first-time home buyer. Finally, you will need to complete Form 5329, Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans (including IRAs) and Other Tax-Favored Accounts. As I understand it now, that means that I have to pay the penalty because I went over the $10,000 because they made me take the tax out. To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the IRS, we inform you that any U.S. federal tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.

James writes that for faith to be authentic, it must prioritize our care for the orphans and widows in distress. As a matter of faith, Christians must approach the immigrants at FLETC with upmost compassion. We are called to be the Good News, standing in solidarity with Christ in confidence and love. While the current situation raises the issues in powerful ways, expressing hatred toward, fear of, or anger with women and children serves nothing to resolve national debate. Jesus modeled human compassion over legalistic adherence throughout his ministry.",0,0

4691,"The Ronsvalles noted if congregational members in 2010 had given at the same percentage of income as members did in 1968, $2.8 billion more would have been available for the churchs mission purpose. Whatever church leaders taught about money, church members were not convinced to maintain, let alone to increase, the portion of income directed to the church, the study concludes. If individual members had given a tithe or 10 percent of their incomes, the churches the study included would have seen an additional $165 billion to pay for the congregations expenses and meet global physical and spiritual needs. While the SBC has stressed global evangelism and promoted several emphases since 1919, by 2012 it had not yet effectively mobilized it members to accomplish that goal, as it strove to balance the needs of its general structure with the challenge of completing the task of taking the gospel to the whole world, the study authors said. The Ronsvalles conclude the decline in giving and membership that began in the 1960s is an indication church leaders did not provide a positive agenda as members disposable income increased. The couple cites an overall decline in giving to churches and the fact that most denominations and their affiliated congregations have failed to develop a specific positive agenda for affluence or a means to help U.S. citizens deal with affluence. The study suggests churches have moved toward a consumer mentality that they must provide comfort or entertainment to attract new members and keep those they have. The study analyzed church member giving by total contributions, gifts to support church finances building upkeep, staff salaries and benefits, curriculum and so forth and benevolence, which includes mission support. The study calculated the potential of the church not only to meet its own needs, but also to further kingdom work. In spite of economic setbacks, the United States remains an affluent country, the couple maintains, but its citizens and institutions sometimes arent certain how to use wealth responsibly.

Documents showed that the bankers brazenly played one firm against another to relax rating criteria and grade risker, longer-term tobacco bonds. Now, a new report from the rating agencies regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, found similar conflicts of interest at the firms, which are supposed to evaluate the riskiness of various debts at arms length from the banks and issuers they serve. In marketing documents collected by ProPublica across 22 tobacco bond offerings, bankers for UBS, Bear Stearns, Citigroup and others repeatedly took credit for getting the firms to bend their criteria.

2922,"China Criticizes US Trade Probe as Protectionism.Chinas Commerce Ministry on Thursday criticized a U.S. decision to launch a trade probe of Beijings technology policy as an attack on the global trading system and said it will resolutely defend Chinese companies. More than 20 percent of 100 American companies that responded to a survey by the U.S.-China Business Council, an industry group, said they were asked to transfer technology within the past three years as a condition of market access. Trade groups welcomed President Donald Trumps Aug. 14 order to look into whether Beijing improperly requires companies to hand over technology as a condition of market access. Trump said in April he was setting aside trade disputes while Washington and Beijing worked together to persuade North Korea to give up nuclear weapons development. The action improperly applies U.S. law instead of international rules and is the destruction of the existing international trade system, said a ministry spokesman, Gao Feng, at a news briefing. We are strongly dissatisfied with this unilateral and protectionist practice and will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese side and Chinese enterprises, said Gao. Beijing requires automakers and other foreign companies in China to work through joint ventures, usually with state-owned partners. Foreign business groups complain companies are being squeezed out of promising Chinese markets or pressured to hand over technology for electric cars and other emerging industries. But American officials have resumed criticizing Chinese policy in recent weeks. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer announced a formal investigation this week. They often are required to give technology to partners that might become competitors.",0,4

Per New York Magazine: In Maureen Dowds interview, she got Trump to budge on the issue, glacially: Wouldnt it have been better, I asked, if Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had simply called the reporter Michelle Fields and apologized for yanking her arm? According to prosecutors, there is a draft apology from Lewandowski to Fields written But according to the state attorney, there was no such apology: Acknowledging international attention to this case, which doesnt exist in just about any other simple battery case, Aronberg said Lewandowski could have prevented the blow-up if he had only apologized to Fields. As The Daily Wire reported on Friday, Lewandowski, appearing on CNNs New Day, claimed that he had tried to contact Fields but never heard back and, once again, accused her of trying to inject herself into the story."" Of course, no apology was necessary from Lewandowski now, the narrative went, but perhaps Fields should apologize to Trump for being a threat and allegedly making contact with him. On Thursday, after the charge was dropped, the Trump campaign put out a statement proclaiming Lewandowskis innocence and explained that the matter is now concluded. I think that had an apology been given at the beginning of all this, we could have avoided the whole criminal justice process for this matter, Aronberg said. Lewandowski still claimed that he never touched her, but it was suggested that it was a security officer that did; the allegation presented by Breitbart News was tweeted out by the Trump camp. After video evidence shows that Lewandowski likely did grab Fields, the campaign manager changed his position yet again: this time, he was a hero.",1,3

11305,"Advertisement - story continues below The majority of the Clinton campaigns negative advertising attacked Trumps characteristics and personality, the study found, and added that fewer than 10 percent of ads attacking Trump focused on his policies whereas about 90 percent was focused on Trump as an individual. A new study, conducted by the Wesleyan Media Project, evidenced how Hillary Clinton devoted an enormous amount of television advertising during the 2016 presidential campaign on personal characteristics and a much smaller amount on actual policy despite the left regularly dubbing her a policy wonk. These strategic differences may have meant that Clinton was more prone to voter backlash and did nothing to overcome the medias lack of focus on Clintons policy knowledge, especially for residents of Michigan and Wisconsin, in particular, who were receiving policy-based (and specifically economically-focused) messaging from Trump. In another example of the fake news from the liberal mainstream media, they framed Clinton as a policy wonk, but often criticized Trump for supposedly lacking substance despite him regularly discussing policy. Advertisement - story continues below In fact, the study published on Monday found that Clintons TV advertising had the least amount of policy since at least the 2000 election, the Washington Free Beacon reported. As the Wesleyan study found, Clintons strategy was a loser: Evidence suggests that negativity in advertising can have a backlash effect on the sponsor (Pinkleton 1997) and that personally-focused, trait-based negative messages (especially those that are uncivil) tend to be seen as less fair, less informative, and less important than more substantive, policy-based messaging (Fridkin and Geer 1994; Brooks and Geer 2007). While Clinton suffered an epic loss in 2016, she also has the dubious distinction of being the only candidate, from any party, to spend less than 40 percent of their TV advertising focusing on policy since 2000.

14725,"In a study last year, RAND researchers found that states with legal marijuana dispensaries see lower rates of opioid overdose and abuse. A study this summer in Health Affairs found that doctors are less likely to prescribe prescription painkillers in states that have legalized marijuana. The striking implication is that medical marijuana laws, when implemented, may represent a promising approach for stemming runaway rates of non-intentional opioid analgesic-related deaths, wrote neuroscientist Marie Hayes in an editorial accompanying the study. Nadelmann is excited, not only about the usual touted pros of legalizing marijuana, but also because of a lesser-known benefit: Several studies have found that rates of opioid overdose drop when pot becomes legal. Some suspect that marijuana is acting as a replacement for opioid painkillers; others reason that it is because marijuana is an enhancerit magnifies the effects of opioids, thus leading patients to take lower painkiller doses but feel the same level of pain relief. In a 2014 JAMA Internal Medicine study, researchers found that opioid overdose deaths fell by an average of 25 percent following the passage of marijuana legalization laws. Ive always avoided making these arguments [about the health benefits of marijuana] when I debate marijuana policy in public because it makes me sound like the people who go, Hemp will save the universe!'

And remember how almost all of the media obsessed with Mitt Romneys statement over Benghazi, and colluded to ask Romney gotcha questions while downplaying and obfuscating what really happened. - 60 Minutes had an absolutely devastating report on the Obama administrations failure to protect Ambassador Chris Stevens and other Americans in Benghazi. Hillary and Obama blamed a video and stood by the caskets perpetuating that lie. (h/t @60Minutes) Ken Gardner (@kesgardner) October 27, 2013 Watch these videos, and consider the cold hearts that blamed a video for political purposes when they knew it was not true: State Department refused to allow security guards to carry guns at the US mission in Benghazi. 60 Minutes said its investigation took almost a year.

Having run shelters in Illinois for 15 years, and being quite involved in helping homeless kids get an education, I figured it was time to see what homelessness was like in the rest of the country. For a metro area of around 1 million people, with a poverty rate hovering near 25 percent despite the gallant efforts of human service professionals, volunteers and supporters this city appears to have a significant gap meeting the needs of houseless parents with babies, toddlers, school kids and youths on their own. Ive hit all 48 contiguous states, filmed two well-received documentaries featuring homeless kids and women, and seen more of our great nations economic demise than any of our elected officials. Opportunity Exists To Help Homeless..................................................................................................................................................................................... Alas, one major concern taints your otherwise ideal community standing. ADVERTISEMENT My biggest shock was discovering how many communities small towns, mid-sized cities, resort communities and larger metro areas (like Albuquerque) lack adequate resources to care for homeless families and youths. Other than overcrowded Joy Junction and the handful of smaller but invaluable shelter programs, thousands of families and youths without homes have no safe place to stay. The economy hasnt helped, but even in more robust times, times would be hard. Many legislators Ive spoken to in my travels, from mayors to members of Congress, seem unaware of the scope of homelessness in their communities. Id love to return next year to find that significant steps have been taken to ease the suffering of homeless families and youths in your community. Homeless families and youths tend to be a less-visible issue. Think of it from your familys perspective: What if tragedy hit domestic violence, natural disaster, major medical incident, job loss coupled with eviction, to",0,0

I wonder even how many establishment Republicans, who are quick to disavow Moore, ever said a single word about Clinton's rape accusations?

So, while even I'm tired of the ""what about Clinton"" game, I must say: seriously though, what about Clinton? Suddenly these people have decided that every sex assault or rape accuser must be believed, every accusation against a prominent man must be given the undivided attention of the entire country, and any man accused of these crimes must be drummed out of public life. Are we supposed to just ignore and forget the fact that these very same people twice elected an alleged rapist to the White House, and then, just last year, tried to elect his wife, who reportedly intimidated and silenced the accusers? Whatever a person is pretending to believe or care about today, you can almost certainly find an example in the not-so-distant past when they didn't believe or care about that thing at all. Are we supposed to allow the Left to pretend that the last 3 decades they spent bowing to the Clinton Machine never happened? How many of these liberals, who are apoplectic about a guy with a potentially unsavory past becoming a Senator in Alabama, expressed any reservations at all about making a potential rapist President of the United States? Yet he was made president, and then made president again, and then liberals tried to put him back in the White House last year by electing his wife, who allegedly led the campaign to silence and discredit her husband's victims.

10161,"Along with Law Professor Kevin Barry of Quinnipiac University, GLAD and other trans rights groups filed a friend-of-the-court brief in January arguing by maintaining the trans exclusion, the ADA perpetrates the kind of discrimination it seeks to dismantle. Kate Lynn Blatt, a transgender employee at the hunter gear Cabelas Retail, filed a discrimination claim against her employer under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on the grounds the store discriminated against her based on her sex; and the ADA, on the basis the store refused to reasonably accommodate her by denying her use of a restroom consistent with her gender identity and the ability to wear a nametag with her correct name. Jennifer Levi, director of GLADs trans rights project, said the Justice Departments decision to avoid the trans exclusion in a statement of interest filed on July 21 is surprising and disappointing. In a statement in December, the Justice Department followed suit, saying the U.S. government would no longer deny the law covers gender-identity discrimination. Levi added the filing has two silver linings: the reassertion that Title VII prohibits workplace discrimination against transgender people and language that enables the Justice Department to revisit the trans exclusion at a later time. In a four-page statement of interest signed by trial attorney Emily Nestler, the Justice Department asks the court to hold off on determining the constitutionality of ADAs trans exclusion until the challenge on the basis of Title VII is resolved. Given the rank animus behind it, the exclusion serves to marginalize and stigmatize a minority group that the DOJ has recognized needs and deserves legal protections, Levi said. The Justice Department ducked on whether the trans exclusion in ADA is unconstitutional. (Photo by Mbiama via Wikimedia Commons) Gay amp; Lesbian Advocates amp; Defenders took the Justice Department to task in a statement last week for declining to weigh in on the explicit transgender exclusion written into the 1990 law.

11567,"Advocates of the Voting Rights Act provision point to states that are implementing new election rules that make voting more difficult, including for minority groups. The challenge points to a provision in the law that requires states with a history of racial bias to seek permission before changing their voting laws from either the US Attorney General or a three-judge panel of the District Court of the District of Columbia. The particular provision that will be argued before the court is: Whether Congress Decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the voting Rights Act exceeded its authority under the fourteenth and fifteenth Amendments and thus violated the tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution. Opponents of the Voting Rights Act argue that the federal law oversteps the bounds of Article I Sec. 4 of the Constitution declares that the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators. Section 4(b) requires that the new voting rules within covered jurisdictions must be precleared by the Attorney General or the three-judge panel in a District Court in the District of Columbia. Since 1965 the Act has extended protection to voters whose English proficiency can be a barrier to voting, prohibits purging voter rolls of voters who did not participate in the last election, and ensures that voters who appear at a poll can participate without an ID if they sign an affidavit. The challenge comes in the wake of an election where minority voters played a determinative role in national leadership and where several states attempted to implement voting restrictions that would fall especially hard on minority groups.

Although images of American dead during the Iraq war were strictly controlled from 1991 to 2009, photojournalists couldnt even take photos of the flag-draped coffins of fallen American soldiers a few shocking images made their way to American audiences. But I think part of our horror stems from the fact we rarely see images of American victims of war. Graphic images of war are hard to stomach — but some say they're necessary.For those in news media, the decision of whether or not to publish graphic images of war is fraught with ethical dilemmas. One of the lasting images of the era is that of three dead American soldiers on a New Guinea beach after the Battle of BunaGona.#160; The photograph was taken by war photojournalist George Strock for LIFE magazine in 1943. While the imagery might be equally horrifying, he argues the cases must be handled differently when it comes time to publish. Maass has covered the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he witnessed things that most Americans only see in photographs. Maass thinks it should be up to the viewer to actively seek out those images, but that there is value in bearing witness to the grim realities of conflict especially when the victims are your fellow countrymen. As long as photography and war have existed simultaneously, there have been graphic images and, with those images, the decision whether or not to publish them. ""Fallujah was invaded on two occasions subsequently, at terrible cost to American life, as well as obviously Iraqi life. For some, the answer is clear: Dont expose your audience to gruesome, unsettling imagery, especially when they are unprepared.

The annual defense authorization bill has passed every year for more than five decades and the chairmen of the House and Senate Armed Services committees are eager to avoid breaking the streak. Advertisement The House has passed legislation that would make several of the tax breaks permanent; the Senate's approach has been to extend them only for 2014 and 2015. Obama's move to protect millions of immigrants from deportation proceedings and make them eligible for work permits appears to have made it more difficult to navigate the must-do items through a Capitol where cooperation already was in short supply. Their to-do list includes keeping the government running into the new year, renewing expired tax breaks for individuals and businesses and approving a defense policy measure that has passed for more than 50 years in a row. Facing diminished budgets, three defense secretaries - Robert Gates, Leon Panetta and Chuck Hagel - have insisted that the cost of personnel benefits have become unsustainable and threaten the Pentagon's ability to prepare the military for fighting a war. Legislation to renew the government's terrorism risk insurance program, which expires at year's end, is eagerly sought by the construction, real estate and hospitality businesses.

Legal experts believe prosecutors will reshape their case for Round Two, although its not yet clear why jurors couldnt reach a verdict, or how close they came. He advised jurors when the trial ended, after a week of testimony and 52 hours of deliberations, that they need not discuss the case, even as the public debates whether age, race, gender or other issues separated them. It can never be clearer that if you speak up, you could be chilling the justice system in the future if jurors are needed in this case, ONeill told them. She believes the breakdown of the first Cosby jury is important to know, but perhaps not predictive of how the second trial might go. ADVERTISEMENT The key to retrying a case is to do it differently the second time, because the defense expects you to do it the same way, said Constands lawyer, Dolores Troiani. Publicist Andrew Wyatt raised a clenched fist as he led the legally blind Cosby out of the courthouse after the jury deadlocked Saturday, while cameras popped and his lead defense lawyer walked away. Do they want to save Cosby, or do what the first jury couldnt do, which was convict him? She also recalled a Los Angeles case where an 11-1 vote to acquit in the first trial ended with a conviction the second time around. We can now wonder if a lot of those kinds of attitudes were at play in Bill Cosbys rape case, said Armour, who teaches at the University of South California.

Make most of early learning, target cash to kindergarten.When Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced the new $500 million Early Learning Challenge Grant competition in late May, educators werent the only ones who joined him at the event. The goals: improve low-income childrens access to early learning programs; develop better coordination among the mosaic of programs already offered; provide better training for those who work in the field, who are often low-paid and lack college degrees; and create clear learning standards and age-appropriate, high-quality assessments for young children. While the majority of children in Chicago are in full-day kindergarten, it comes at a price: The district only foots the bill for a half-day program, forcing schools to pay the rest of the cost of a full-day program with their discretionary money. One way to do so is to target cash to full-day kindergarten across the board. The Chicago Program Evaluation Project, a study of Chicago preschool programs, found that high-risk children (including those learning English or living in a single-parent home) made substantial progress in vocabulary development, literacy and math. Like the previous Race to the Top rounds, Duncan says he wants this one to be a game-changer that will strengthen early childhood programs. Source: Transition and Alignment policy brief, 2010, Education Commission of the States In Chicago, the need for strong transition and alignment takes on added importance because of the gains low-income children are making in preschool.

8929,"Even a small royalty could rejuvenate our public-lands system, help clean up abandoned mines and mine waste, and put people back to work. If taxpayers received an 8 percent royalty on $6.4 billion, that would mean more than $500 million a year we could put back into managing our public lands and reducing our national debt. Today, some of the worlds biggest companies make a mint by mining our metals, selling them to the highest bidder, keeping all the profits and often sticking taxpayers with a costly cleanup bill. As our nation works to address the deficit in the months ahead, we can no longer allow federal giveaways of our natural resources to continue without any compensation to the taxpayers who own those resources. Disputes about what royalty rate to charge, how to calculate company profits, and what benefits would go to local mining communities have managed to stall decades of reform efforts. It is long overdue for Congress and the administration to act to finally demand, and get, a fair price for the publics hardrock minerals. The Department of the Interior, using estimates and partial information, put a ballpark figure of $6.4 billion on the value of hardrock minerals extracted from federal land in 2011. The president proposed hardrock mining reform measures in each of his past two budgets, and we hope to see this repeated in his fiscal year 2014 request due this month. With prices for gold, silver and other minerals at near-record highs, requiring companies to pay a royalty for public resources is simply good policy. But the only way mining reform will happen is if the public becomes aware of its importance. Blame this bizarre omission of royalties on the 1872 Mining Law, which encouraged Westward expansion by allowing prospectors to stake claims on public lands and freely remove hardrock minerals like gold, silver, copper and uranium. Why should companies get a free ride while the national budget is slashed and parks close for lack of funds?",0,0

The AUMF is exactly what its title would suggest: An authorization of military force against those involved in 9/11, not an authorization to secretly break law clearly set down by another branch of government. I will also argue that, accordingly, an independent special prosecutor must be appointed to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute those responsible for the violation including the President and those who knowingly carried out his orders in violation of the law. The President seems to contend that a subsequent statutethe post-9/11 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) created an implicit exception to FISA. Unsurprisingly, not a single Senator has come out in support of the Presidents claim that the AUMF gave the president the authority to go around the FISA law to wiretap Americans. First, it claimed that in order to avoid constitutional conflict, any ambiguity as to how to interpret FISA and the AUMF ought to be resolved in the Presidents favor. Indeed, it would stabilize that balance by fulfilling the settled expectations created by those longstanding, sensible rules of statutory construction that say that specific statutes govern the specific areas they address, unless specifically superseded. The Inherent Authority Defense In addition to invoking the AUMF, the DOJ claims that warrantless wiretapping is legal because the President has the well-recognized inherent constitutional authority as Commander in Chief and sole organ for the Nation in foreign affairs to conduct warrantless surveillance of enemy forces for intelligence purposes to detect and disrupt armed attacks on the United States.

The OECD said the Bank of England's interest rates were appropriate for the British economic outlook and said China had scope to ease monetary conditions. Providing the deadlock in Washington is overcome, the world's biggest economy will grow 2.0 percent next year, the OECD estimated, cutting its forecast from 2.6 percent in May.

ADVERTISEMENT Brunson said hes also seen instances of a taxpayer experiencing recurring problems with a scammer filing fake returns in their name year after year. An IRS brochure titled Identity Theft Prevention and Victim Assistance recommends that taxpayers: Dont give out Social Security numbers to a business just because they ask, only when absolutely necessary. Watson noted the IRS could set up the tax return system to prevent all fraud, but then it would take an especially long time to process refunds. He said the IRS has dedicated more agents to work the cases, and people are getting caught and going to prison. Brunson said the IRS established a special unit for people to report cases where they believe their identity was stolen. It can happen in 10 days or less, but were doing more things up front and checking for fraud, Brunson said. That way, even if a criminal has access to the persons Social Security number and other information, it wont do them any good because the specially issued number is required to file the return. ADVERTISEMENT Watson said if a person has their identity and tax return stolen, the victim will get their money back. Watson said the IRS has seen a major increase in identity theft cases over the past 10 years.

8532,"Death of American detained in North Korea baffles experts..................................................................................................................................................................................... SEOUL, South Korea North Koreas missile and nuclear tests, its carefully scripted propaganda bluster, even its military threats: Far from the scattershot workings of a madman, most of this fits the playbook of a small, proud country well used to stoking tensions to get concessions it would otherwise not receive from surrounding big powers. The country may not worry about much of anything externally, even the death of a young tourist, until it reaches its goal of building a nuclear ICBM that can ease what it sees as decades of U.S. and South Korean hostility. It jars so strikingly with the fates of most past detained Americans that outside observers are left struggling not only with the mystery of what killed Warmbier but also with what his death means for attempts by Washington and its allies to stop North Koreas pursuit of a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can target the U.S. mainland. Some outside experts see an internal divide in North Korea between officials who believe solving the long standoff with Seoul and Washington is the best way to improve the countrys economy and international standing, and hard-liners who believe that outside pressure, isolation and animosity help keep the ruling Kim family in power by solidifying domestic support. Moon said in an interview with CBS television broadcast Tuesday that Warmbiers death showed we must now have the perception that North Korea is an irrational regime, but talks are still necessary because we were unable to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through only the sanctions and pressure. Warmbiers death could make it even harder, although some analysts think Moon could offer talks with the North as a way to get other detainees out of North Korea. Delury said the Trump administration may try to pressure China to cut its large numbers of tourists to North Korea until the North apologizes and releases the other Americans. But North Korea has also consistently lobbied Washington for specific concessions that would need deep negotiations, something recent U.S. administrations have been reluc",0,0

4710,"However, Joshua Frank and those who choose to follow his example are doing a great disservice to what could be an epochal event a point of decision at which a larger leftist party in America does not split down the middle and collapse under its own hubris. Given that the Greens are still the best hope for a multi-tendency, democratic, left-wing party in the US, we simply cannot abandon the struggle. My point is that the left within the party cannot simply abandon the struggle and the organization to the Cobbites. Maybe we could have a real internal debate about the issues Frank has been raising, or force one if the Cobbites do not wish to have one willingly. As disparate as Bernstein, Luxemburg, Jaures and Lenin were, they coexisted within the broader social democratic movement until the outbreak of the First World War, debated, and did not abandon the struggle because of rightward drift one year or one election season. Joshua Frank ignores the very substantial discontent within the party for Cobbs policies, and the desire for a left-wing tendency/faction. Alongside this, the tradition of internal party dissent and discussion though it exists and is allowed has not been familiarized to the extent that European leftist parties consider normal. Many states which send delegates to the convention or the party leadership councils have small party bodies which are distantly connected to broader struggles, and more likely to respond to the pressures of liberals surrounding a very small political party. How could a political party that prided itself on resistance to ruling class parties suddenly hiccup and nominate a candidate whose entire campaign has been about lying prostrate in front of the Democratic Party? The left in America has a history of splintering apart at the first sign of weakness or drift to the right in a political party. More than any other leftist party in the US, the Greens can lay claim to being something of a mass party, with at least 200,000 members across the country and many more sympathizers.

Moore was later suspended from the bench for obstructing the federal court on same-sex marriage as a result of an ethics charge filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Scott McCoy, senior staff attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the ruling makes clear the responsibilities of Alabama state officials after the Supreme Court decision. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide, the Alabama Supreme Court in March declined withdraw its order against same-sex marriage. A federal court ordered judges in Alabama to grant same-sex marriage licenses. The legal groups who filed the initial federal lawsuit in Alabama sought a permanent injunction from Granade to make clear Alabama must respect the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in the order on Wednesday. Prior to the Supreme Court in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide, Granade in January 2015 had struck down Alabamas laws prohibiting gay nuptials as unconstitutional. The legal groups who sought the order were the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the ACLU of Alabama, the Southern Poverty Law Center and Americans United for Separate of Church and State.",0,2

That could mean the roughly 100 residents would see their property taxes skyrocket to cover payments on $16 million in bond debt incurred to build a water treatment system and other infrastructure at Mariposa. Agreements High Desert signed when the PID was established say the developer must pay the difference if property taxes dont bring in enough. The agreements also say that if the developer doesnt pay, the PID board must raise the property tax rate to make up the difference. Mariposa Meeting Will Be Friday..................................................................................................................................................................................... High Desert Investment Corp. representatives recently informed residents of the 1,465-acre high-end master planned community in far north Rio Rancho that the company was pulling out of the project and had listed it with an Arizona land sales specialist. High Desert projected that more than 1,600 homes would be built, but the economic downturn dashed those expectations and tax revenues havent been sufficient to meet the bond payments. ADVERTISEMENT High Desert sold the bonds in 2006 after Rio Rancho City Council approved establishing a public improvement district, or PID, for Mariposa. A PID is a mechanism that allows a developer to sell bonds to cover the cost of infrastructure through a tax levied on community residents.

We first addressed this popular theme in 2004, when we reported on a John Kerry campaign ad in which he blamed President George W. Bush for providing tax incentives to companies outsourcing jobs overseas.#160;At the time we found that such tax breaks, which do exist, pre-dated the Bush administration and that even Democratic-leaning economists did not support the idea that changing the corporate tax code would end the movement of jobs overseas. Clinton, Nov. 19, 2007: And we are going to finally close the tax loopholes and stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. A: Companies with overseas subsidiaries can keep their income untaxed by the IRS if they dont transfer that revenue back to the U.S. Oil and gas companies received tax breaks and subsidies from a 2005 energy bill, but the bill led to a net tax increase for them. Both leading Democratic candidates have referred to tax breaks to oil companies: Clinton, July 23, 2007: First of all, I have proposed a strategic energy fund that I would fund by taking away the tax break for the oil companies, which have gotten much greater under Bush and Cheney. The ad implied that corporate tax breaks were responsible for the shipment of jobs overseas from an Iowa Maytag plant.#160;We found that the jobs were actually sent to Ohio and that, again, eliminating such tax breaks would not go far in stanching the flow of jobs overseas. And heres why: In the U.S., companies are taxed 35 percent on earnings of $10 million to $15 million or on all earnings over $18.3 million.#160;Thats one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, making an overseas move somewhat attractive to companies that wish to avoid the U.S. tax rate.#",0,0

8669,"To improve capacity at hospitals, financial responsibility for the costs of preparation should be given either to the public as a whole or to the activities and organizations associated with increased risk of casualties. Ambulances to Nowhere: America's Critical Shortfall in Medical Preparedness for Catastrophic Terrorism.Discussion Paper - Harvard Kennedy School While the public assumes the medical community and hospitals are adequately prepared for terrorist attacks, in reality hospitals are having problems keeping up with everyday capacity. Millions of dollars have been spent on supporting weapons of mass destruction training for first responders, but not as much has been spent on hospital preparedness even though hospital health care capacity is more expensive and just as important as first-responder capacity. Hospitals keep a minimum supply of sterile supplies, equipment, and drugs, have a restricted workforce, and have difficulty maintaining immediately available medical specialists, all of which results in little surge capacity. The public, emergency responders and policymakers have limited knowledge of mass casualty care issues. Regulations reflect the public assumption that hospitals are prepared. Other factors include unfounded mandates, charity cases, and a national shortfall of nurses. The 1997 Balanced Budget Amendment curtailed longstanding Federal financial support for medical training programs. For example, Title III of the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986 led to guidelines that recommend that individual hospitals be ready to receive contaminated chemical casualties. Adequate preparation for mass casualty events is expensive and time-consuming. Financial constraints have been placed on hospitals. At the same time, expenses for new equipment, medications, construction, and maintenance have gone up.",0,0
2840,"Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force an independent group of national experts that issues recommendations on preventive care last week reported insufficient evidence that taking 400 international units daily does anything to prevent bone fractures, studies of higher Vitamin D doses have shown a reduced risk of fractures. Over the last five years, there have been some studies to suggest that taking a calcium supplement raises blood calcium levels and could precipitate into the arteries, says Felicia Cosman, senior clinical director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation and author of What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Osteoporosis. For Cosman and all the other experts I spoke with, the most basic tips for bone health still count the most: Avoid smoking, eat a healthful diet rich in calcium and get plenty of weight-bearing exercise. Most of the data show that dietary calcium is better for you and your bone integrity, so if you can get the calcium you need through your diet, you shouldnt take a calcium supplement. If you do have osteoporosis or osteopenia (a less severe form of low bone density), your doctor can perform tests to determine if you need more calcium, more Vitamin D, a change in medication or treatment for an underlying condition. But because most Vitamin K2 studies have been relatively small, many physicians dont yet feel the case for the nutrient is strong enough, Cosman says. But an even larger study in 2004 found that overall dietary calcium intake actually reduced kidney-stone risk. Unless you have a medical condition (such as celiac disease) that impairs your ability to absorb nutrients, eating a varied, healthful diet that includes calcium-rich foods such as milk and yogurt should do the trick, Cosman says no calcium supplements required. A large 2006 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that women taking a 1,000-milligram calcium supplement were more likely to develop kidney stones than women taking a placebo. But theres a common thread: None of the heart or kidney risks were associated with calcium from food. Experts disagree about how much you need and how well it prevents osteoporosis or bone fractures.

UPDATED Continue Reading Below An investment advisor ripped off three pro athletes by secretly investing millions of dollars in a troubled online ticket seller, according to a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company was dependent on the cash infusions to stay in business, the SEC said, and Narayan received nearly $2 million in undisclosed finders fees, mostly from his clients funds. Peavy had about $15 million invested in The Ticket Reserve, despite never authorizing any money to the company, the lawsuit said.

Denying Assange internet access at the height of Wikileaks publication of damaging information against Clinton then strengthens the speculations that Correa is bent on healing and improving relations between his country and the U.S. by doing Hillary a favor, and having rosier prospects for better ties if she wins the presidency. Internet Connection of Wikileaks Founder Assange Cut In the Height of Hillary Email Leaks Could it be just a case of suspicious timing or could there be credence in what Republican nominee Donald Trump has been warning everyone that there's a conspiracy to make Hillary Clinton claim the White House at all costs? This comes to light after Ecuador just cut the internet access of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange after a series of online publication of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chair John Podesta, revealing in its wake pretty damaging information about Hillary and her camp. Assange has earlier also expressed fears that he would be extradited to the U.S. for espionage in the event that he leaves the Ecuadorian embassy in London. It does not help assuage fears that the internet disconnection of Assange is politically-motivated with the recent admission of Correa in an interview with Russia Today that he does favor Hillary. Making matters worse between the two countries' ties was the unilateral pulling out of Ecuador from a bilateral trade pact with the U.S., after allegations that the U.S. is using the deal to blackmail Ecuador as regards to the asylum request of former NSA staffer Edward Snowden. Just recently, it was the Obama administration who was accusing Wikileaks and Russia of interfering with the U.S. elections with the release of hacked Podesta emails.

The equipment and pieces were flown from a parking lot at the ski valleys 9,200-foot base up the peak by an aerial truck helicopter specially designed for repetitive lifting. He believes the ski valley, long known as a skiers ski area and famously a latecomer to allowing snowboards, will now bring in a broader audience so its a little bit more inclusive of a broader range of skiers at all levels. Its really inspiring and this a historic day in Taos and I am really glad I could be here to see some of the towers going in. It was something Ernie (ski area founder Ernie Blake) envisioned, I would say 40 years ago, but we never got it built. In the last six or seven years, I have probably built 70 or 80 ski lifts, said Jorgenson. He says the hardest part of an operation like that at Taos is dealing with the wind. The lift, first envisioned years ago, is becoming a reality under the new ownership and via the checkbook of billionaire hedge fund operator Louis Bacon, who bought the resort earlier this year.

7662,"Floridas manatees need even more stringent protections than their listing on the federal endangered species list, Groff said, adding that boaters should go elsewhere if they dont like speed limits in waters where manatees swim. ADVERTISEMENT The truth is, the manatee is protected the same as threatened or endangered, but they no longer can use the species to take over sovereign lands and sovereign waters with arbitrary rules, said Steve Lamb, vice president of Save Crystal River, which represents about 100 members who include recreational boaters, tour operators, dive shops and hotels. Critics of the manatees endangered listing say they are important to the states tourism industry and environment, so everyone wants them to thrive, but the species has recovered sufficiently over the past 47 years to be reclassified. Save the Manatees Club Executive Director Pat Rose said that while the species has rebounded, the jump in deaths, particularly during cold snaps, means more work is needed before it loses endangered status. ADVERTISEMENT Groffs comments are representative of the environmentalist and general public side of an ongoing fight with a group of boaters, businesses and conservatives over whether the manatee should retain its 1967 federal listing as an endangered species, the most protective classification. According to the wildlife service, officials began working on the reclassification proposal in 2013, but efforts were suspended amid funding constraints, the U.S. government shutdown and concerns over spikes in manatee deaths, particularly during cold snaps. Florida residents cite the manatees with scars from run-ins with boats or fishing debris, while out-of-state commenters describe the thrill of spotting the unique marine mammals in the water. If we come to the end of this and decide reclassification is warranted, its good news because it means the manatee is recovering and no longer on the brink of extinction, agency spokesman Chuck Underwood said. Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing whether the manatee should be reclassified as a threatened species, which would allow some flexibility as the species recovers, while maintaining most of the protection",0,0
8412,"The research finds that the problem of bird deaths is being made worse by the proliferation of large communications towers that send radio and television signals around the country. The joint American-Canadian study, said that birds are often attracted to the lights glowing on the giant towers. Bird deaths: TV and radio towers kill millions of birds per year.Bird deaths number in the millions in North America due to collisions with communications towers, a new report suggests. Tech Vibes reported that cloudy weather makes the situation even more dangerous, as birds are forced to fly low and risk running into towers. ""In the presence of the solid red lights, the birds are unable to get out of their spell,"" said lead author, Travis Longcore of the University of Southern California, according to Phys Org. ""With these towers, we are killing birds in an unnatural way. CBC reported that the continent's 84,000 communications towers kill nearly seven million birds that are traversing North America to warmer southern climates. Blinking red lights are much less risky to birds, the report suggests. ""They circle the tower and run into the big cables holding it up."" Songbirds, such as orioles and warblers, are the most common victims. The research was published in the journal PloS ONE. ""This tragedy, it doesn't have to be,"" said Longcore.",0,2

4074,"So Stupid: Fox News Guest Says CNN ‘Needs Illegal Immigrants to Get Their Ratings Up’.The rights relentless campaign to demonize immigrants is an openly racist attempt to make America white again. Something else that Fox News will never accept is the fact that undocumented immigrants commit far fewer crimes than native-born citizens. Listen, I dont know whats going on over there, whether its wacky tobacky or Latin lettuce in the break rooms or what not, but the American people right now, we want our polticians to enforce the laws. And every time there is any crime committed by an undocumented resident, Fox News goes bonkers trying to associate the crime with the persons residency status. Whats more, if Dupree thinks that drunk driving fatalities are caused by people who dont like America, then let him explain the 10,000 annual deaths caused by drunk driving American citizens. They need illegal immigrants to watch their ratings, to get their ratings back up so thats why theyre calling them patriotic. Does he really think that anyone would get drunk, then take the car out for spin because they dont like America? That would be stupid enough by itself, but its even worse when accusing people who take great risks to come to this country of not caring about it. The discussion was triggered by a clip from CNN wherein host Brooke Baldwin stated the obvious truth that its wrong to imply that all immigrants are criminals. But why let facts get in the way of a good racist narrative? But Republicans are determined to conflate these good neighbors with criminals and force them to leave their families and businesses for no reason other than their hatred of what they consider dark-skinned invaders. But co-host Steve Doocy still had to admit that he couldnt understand what Baldwin was talking about: Doocy: Youve got her saying that people are here for all kinds of valid and patriotic reasons.",1,1

Knowing that New Yorkers would be more supportive of violence against the hard core underclass than they would against young idealists, they lost no time in portraying Zucotti Parks occupiers as first, dirty hippies, and, when that didnt work, drug users, thieves, and, finally, rapists. Whether, as Harry Siegal of the New York Daily News maintains, the NYPD was encouraging the homeless to go downtown to Zucotti Park for free meals and the opportunity to panhandle in a relatively unmolested environment, or whether they just came on their own accord, the Occupy Wall Street encampment had become, by late October, a magnet for the citys most downtrodden citizens. The 1% and their employees in the media and the NYPD hope they have put the genie back into the bottle, and they have indeed scored a devastating victory over Occupy Wall Street, but the kind of ham handed propaganda and brute physical repression they used on November 15 can work only in the very short run. Look at that photo in the New Yorker, you people in the 1%, look at that pale little man you kicked out of his home in Zucotti Park, that lonely little soul you drove away from his newly found companions. Millers attack, which was in many ways, a culmination of a running campaign in the corporate media to discredit Occupy Wall Street, expressed an almost obsessive interest in the bodily functions of the activists who were camping out in Zucotti Park, bodily functions, we can presume, or at least hope, he shares. To anybody who spent time in the now demolished Zucotti Park tent city, there are no longer two clear cut categories, homeless and not homeless, human and untouchable, dirty hippy or respectable protester. For those two months in Zucotti Park, Occupy Wall Street was their",1,1

I am reminded of a musician friend of mine who once told me that he, upon first meeting certain women throughout his life, had always received a particular sensation if this would eventually be someone he would later begin dating. While science still remains unable to prove conclusively that certain individuals can see into the future or read the minds of others, there nonetheless seem to be instances where proof exists, supporting that these things can, and often do, occur. In doing so, could we possibly discover that proposed psychic abilites may actually be the result of such things as natural selection, and even underlying biological processes occurring within the body? While every individual should be allowed the ability to earn their living, the process of commercializing the unexplained often casts strange phenomenon like ESP in a poor light, especially amidst the scientific community.

1538,"Both whistle-blowers made headlines before agreeing to sit for their 60 Minutes interviews, but their stories have a certain open-ended quality to them in that, as Kroft points out in the news magazines report that aired Dec. 4, the Justice Department has yet to bring charges against any major Wall Street players who shared responsibility for the cataclysmic financial implosion that first registered in 2008 and still resonates today. However, she got some satisfaction (other than the nearly $1 million case she eventually won in court against her former employer, now absorbed into Bank of America) by refusing to sign a 14-page document guaranteeing her silence. But luckily, people such as Foster and Bowen were willing to do their jobs and themselves, and consumers justice by first reporting signs of trouble to their higher-ups at Countrywide and Citigroup, respectively, and then refusing to let their former employers buy their silence, even if their ethics cost them their jobs. Truthdiggers of the Week: Two Mortgage Meltdown Whistle-Blowers.Its all too rare that a mainstream news network goes after just the sort of financial heavy hitters that tend to have ties to their own corporate sponsors, but thankfully, thats what CBS News 60 Minutes did last weekend with the help of two principled mortgage specialists. This glaring failure on the part of the DOJ to carry out its duties becomes even more infuriating considering top-tier executives from implicated companies such as Citigroup and Countrywide blatantly denied the parts they played in the meltdown and signed what should have been damning documents to back up their claims. Its also clear, from both of their accounts on 60 Minutes, that they were aware of the risks that taking action might involve, once they got over the shock of discovering the widespread fraud happening under their noses at both firms. For his part, Bowen made waves by taking his story to the top, first at Citigroup (he even sent an email to Robert Rubin in 2007) and then on Capitol Hill on April 7, 2010, before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. Good thing that he, as well as Foster, did even if the Justice Department couldnt follow their example",1,1
