7547,"Moreover, all the early indications are that the law will, in fact, give millions of Americans who currently lack access to health insurance the coverage they need, while giving millions more a big break in their health care costs. I guess that after all the years of vilification it was predictable that Republican leaders would still fail to understand the principles behind health reform and that this would hamper their ability to craft an effective political response as the reforms implementation draws near. But we know what happens next: many healthy people dont buy insurance, leaving a relatively bad risk pool, leading to high premiums that drive out even more healthy people. As a last ditch effort, many Right Wing and Conservative organizations are spending millions to convince Americans not to sign up hoping that that would cause the programs failure. The#160; employer mandate was delayed one year likely for political reasons as well as to give employers who have been dragging their heels more time to adapt. One would imagine that for those exact reasons within any bill there are unintended consequences that must be subsequently fixed. Start with the goal that almost everyone at least pretends to support: giving Americans with pre-existing medical conditions access to health insurance. Finally, since buying insurance could be a hardship for lower-income Americans, you need subsidies to make insurance affordable for all. And Republicans who deluded their supporters into believing that none of this would happen will probably pay a large personal price. Insurance companies will be allowed caps for one more year, likely for political reasons as well as to keep rates lower in particular markets. Governments can, if they choose, require that insurance companies issue policies without regard to an individuals medical history, community rating, and some states, including New York, have done just that. And because so many people will see clear benefits, health reform will prove irreversible.",1,1

SALT LAKE CITY A powerful outdoor recreation industry executive said Tuesday the worlds largest outdoor retail show going on this week in Salt Lake City should leave Utah if the states top political leaders continue what he calls an assault on public lands. Black Diamond Equipment founder Peter Metcalf said keeping the show in Utah makes the industry complicit in supporting rhetoric and strategies that dont align with its values. Herbert has been clear that Utah is, always has been, and always will be a public lands state, Edwards said. Metcalf said he isnt considering moving his company, which he relocated to Utah in 1991, because he doesnt want to upend the lives of his 300 employees and their families. We must be clear that protection of Americas public lands, including those in Utah, are critical and any threat to their protection is a threat to the outdoor industry, the statement reads. He said would be sad if the show moves too but said his industry must do more than just talk to get the attention of Utah political leaders. Utah is really ground zero for the worst public lands policies, he said.

2422,"On Day Two of the convention, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Obamas deportation policies and the removal of about 1.5 million people, delivered a speech in which he also praised Obama for taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from deserving young people. The Democrats rising star was referring to President Obamas announcement several weeks ago that young illegal immigrants not in deportation proceedings could apply to the Department of Homeland Security and possibly receive a two-year work visa that would allow them live in the United States without fear of being removed. The show got under way on Day One when San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro delivered the kind of inspirational keynote speech that Latino Democrats have long been waiting for one that reflects their experience here in the United States. As anyone who follows the immigration debate closely knows, Clinton is the last person who should be talking about opening doors for immigrants. If you think the president was right to open the doors of American opportunity to all those young immigrants brought here when they were young so they can serve in the military or go to college, Clinton told delegates, you must vote for Barack Obama. Later that evening, in what was billed as the first time an undocumented immigrant has addressed a convention of either political party, Benita Veliz a 27-year-old who stands to benefit from Obamas new work-visa policy addressed delegates and introduced to the stage Latina television personality Cristina Saralegui. And because he knows that we dont have an ounce of talent to waste, Castro said, the president took action to lift the shadow of deportation from a generation of young, law-abiding immigrants called dreamers. But who was it who killed the DREAM Act, a bill that would have granted permanent legal status to college-bound students, when it came up for a vote in the Senate in December 2010? Immigration attorneys have told me on numerous occasions that when they fight a deportation order against an individual, one of the biggest obstacles is the lasting effect of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which makes it easier for the federal government to deport illegal immigrants and harder to fight",0,0

He praised veterans for their quiet and selfless service, but the focus of his remarks was on the need for the country to recover from a bruising election campaign, a theme that is likely to dominate his remaining days in office. Obama urges Americans to set aside political grievances on Veterans Day.ARLINGTON, Va. President Barack Obama laid a wreath in Arlington Cemetery on Friday and used his final Veterans Day speech to deliver a plea for unity and to urge Americans to set aside political grievances and follow the example of those who fight the countrys wars. Veterans Day often follows a hard-fought political campaign, he said. Whenever the world makes you cynical, whenever you seek true humility and selflessness, look to a veteran, the president said. He urged his successor to continue work on the tragedy of veteran suicides, which claims 20 lives a day, and to resist calls to outsource and privatize the VA. Obama focused his remarks on an increasingly disaffected and angry electorate. But, the president did not revisit the slights of the campaign trail, focusing instead on the the American instinct to find strength in our common creed, to forge unity from our great diversity. We can show how much we love our country by loving our neighbors as ourselves, Obama said. The president defended his administrations record on veterans issues, noting that he had increased funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs by 85 percent over the course of his two terms in office, improved access to mental health services and cut veteran homelessness in half. The president, normally a polished and confident speaker, seemed to stumble over his words at the beginning of his address.

14564,"Here's What He Says..There is some speculation that 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney might make a late bid for a 2016 presidential run through a brokered convention after he gave a scathing speech warning against real estate mogul Donald Trump. With all that in mind, consider the following: Little birdie tells me Team Rubio didn't work early voting hard in FL because they were afraid of turning out Jeb's voters before dropping. Thursday's CNN report about Romney looking to stop Trump at a contested convention didn't come out of a vacuum. A scenario where Kasich and Rubio lose their home states, or even if they both win their home states and the field remains fractured, leaves an opening for Romney, the establishment's ideal candidate, to swoop in at a brokered convention. Perhaps that could happen, because if Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) wins Florida, he would be in a better position to go into a brokered convention and be the man the establishment shoves down the throats of the base. Little Birdie tells me Rubio's favorables among FL GOP voters are 20 points worse than Cruz's were in Texas. He's out of money and organization and trotting to Puerto Rico and Kansas Overall, it doesn't look good for Rubio in Florida. The people who can save this party are Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio or John Kasich."" But what happens if Rubio loses Florida?

He said that he did not think the Iran nuclear issue would be resolved by the end of the Bush administration and would still be outstanding when a new administration takes office. We are all anxious to continue to keep on the table the offer to negotiate with Iran, Burns said. Departing US Iran Envoy Says Nuclear Issue Will Not Be Resolved By Time Bush Leaves Office.Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Nick Burns, who is due to leave the State Department after twenty-six years of service at the end of the month, spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington tonight. Presumably under the suspension for suspension arrangement Burns mentioned last year the offer that if Iran agrees to suspend uranium enrichment going into negotiations, the international community would suspend international economic sanctions. I asked Burns more about the effort to reiterate to Iran the standing offer to talk with it. Whether that is because Burns feels more free to speak his mind now because hes leaving government service in a few days, or because the administration and its allies have determined they have more time, is not clear; perhaps a bit of both. Among the incentives offered to Iran to negotiate, Burns said: that an international consortium would provide Iran a civilian nuclear power facility, under which Russian would basically haul in the nuclear fuel and haul out the spent fuel. I dont think conflict with Iran is inevitable, Burns said. I heard Burns speak a year ago on US Iran policy, when the US was trying to get a second round of economic sanctions through the UN Security Council. He said Iran and its president Ahmadinejad and other officials had the offer on their desks, using his hands to pantomime someone putting a document on a desk. ",1,1

In the end, the award was a battle between the Texans, and the city of Austin won with Franklins famous brisket. The award was expected to go to one of two Houston, Texas, chefs, but the prize surprisingly was given to someone else. Franklin beat out Hugo Ortega of Hugos and Justin Yu of Oxheart who were expected to win the Best Chef: Southwest award. The award given to Franklin by James Beard Foundation is considered to be the Oscar for chefs. Ever since the opening of his restaurant, Aaron Franklins establishment has been mobbed with huge lines. Aaron Franklin, despite breaking the Houston expectation, still kept the honor in Texas. As for Franklin, hes known for his skills to smoke meats, especially the ethereal brisket that everyone lines up outside his restaurant for. It is the highest honor a chef and his restaurant could get. Other contestants that lost to Franklin were Austinite Bryce Gilmore of Barley Swine, Martin Rios of Restaurant Martin in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Kevin Binkley of Binkleys in Cave Creek, Arizona.

Davis is proud to serve such an idyllic district, saying on her website: San Diego is a tourists paradise, with many major attractions and warm sunny days year round. The 53rd Congressional District engulfs a majority of San Diego, stretching from the heart of the city to the Mexican border, so this position will directly affect how San Diego is represented in Washington. Although Popaditch ran his campaign well- supporting veterans and plausible healthcare Davis defeated him in a landslide. The 53rd District further stretches west and south to the cities of Coronado and Imperial Beach. Davis defeated Republican candidate Michael Crimmins in the 2010 election with 62.26% of the vote, with 104,790 votes to Crimmins 57,227. There are 354,345 registered voters in the 53rd District, of which 101,402 are registered Republicans, and 149,471 are registered Democrats, and 103,472 are other or unaffiliated voters. Nearby are the world-famous Torrey Pines Golf Course, the University of California San Diego, Birch Aquarium, and the picturesque village of La Jolla. The district is bordered to the east is the city of Lemon Grove, and to the south lies the community of La Presa. Surely Representative Davis will continue to perform her duties as she has done within the past five terms.

To Park, the best strategy for fighting these dust storms is to try to keep the soil from leaving Mongolia in the first place. In Korea, trees planted in Mongolia bring hopes for fewer dust storms.While a downpour pounded Seoul on a recent morning, Kwon Byong Hyon had a different sort of storm on his mind. Average summer temperatures in Mongolia are projected to rise up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit by mid-century, which could dry out the Gobi even more and kill the native elms and cedars in which the two have invested so much hope. Park points to yellow and white flowers - a ""small nursery,"" he calls it - and said this new ground cover will help hold the soil in place. Ultimately, Park said, as more windbreaks sprout up, the benefits will reach all the way back to his home in Korea. But the Korean and Mongolian tree planters say they can't let that prospect stop them from doing what they can, while hoping the rest of the world tackles that bigger problem. And it's what the harsh Mongolian winds pick up, carrying first to nearby villages and then miles up into the jet stream, eventually choking cities hundreds and even thousands of miles away in Korea and beyond. At the time, Park was head of the Northeast Asia Forest Forum, and he and his colleague Jamsram Tsogtbaatar, a forestry scientist and an official at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, wanted to prove that they could grow a forest in this unforgiving region. Tsogtbaatar said even now the trees are starting to catch dust from the air. For more than a decade, Park has worked to prevent those dust storms, sometimes alongside Kwon.

Association Health Plans will be among the biggest free-market reforms of health care in a generation, and it will do more to counter the impact of Obamacare than most of the repeal bills did, because it will actually go after regulations that the legislation didnt touch due to Senate rules. Well, nationwide associations like the National Restaurant Association will be allowed to form groups across state lines and, with the leverage of size, demand Big Insurance bring down their outrageous premiums. From Fox News: According to officials, Trump will direct the secretary of labor to consider expanding access to Association Health Plans, which could allow employers to form groups across state lines offering coverage. The Presidents decision today will allow workers from two million restaurants to come together to form a buying group and through sheer size get cheaper and better insurance. The agencies and the secretaries will have to report to Trump in 180 days about any changes that could be made, at the state or the federal level, to increase choices for consumers. But responding to concerns, the White House said participating employers could not exclude any workers from the plan, or charge more to those in poor health. The order also calls on other federal agencies to consider expanding coverage in low-cost, short-term insurance plans not subject to ObamaCare rules. Numerous insurance companies have dropped many Obamacare options due to high costs and not enough profits to keep offering its services. Many of the 28 million people left behind by Obamacare who still dont have insurance work low-wage jobs in our fast food restaurants. The Presidents action today will allow the millions of people in the individual market an escape route to group insurance. Those association health plans could be shielded from some state and federal insurance requirements.",1,3

A river is now treated as key to economic development measured by the big dams, navigation and other developmental projects which has diluted our understanding of a river from a life-line to a resource available for exploitation. A river also repairs itself, creating new ways to flow which can be termed as a rivers expression. Therefore, our own interests are intimately tied with those of the river and the need to demarcate the#160;floodplains#160;of our rivers along with strong laws cannot be over-emphasised. A river not just flow longitudinally, but it also requires horizontal space to#160;expand#160;its spread, which in simple terms can be called flood. Then, the peculiar characteristics of our rivers need to be accepted, respected and protected if we really want to make rights of a river meaningful. However, river activists have equally criticized the same government for promoting dams, navigational dredging, river-inter-linking and undertaking constructions on river banks and floodplains which go against the best interest of the river. Governments and even big financial institutions like the World Bank have consistently neglected the non-use values of our rivers in their cost-benefit analysis of developmental projects on the pretext that the same cannot be calculated with any precision. While most governments are exploring possibilities of optimal utilisation of rivers as a resource, several environmental experts advocate protection of these rivers, its natural flow and its ecology for their and our own sustenance.

However, beyond just the issues facing survivors of domestic violence, SOS and my work has started to become more broadly involved with the social justice movement in Florida. After the first meeting with my group, I kept thinking more about what inspires and motivates me and the reasons I am a part of the movement to end violence against women and girls. The most important thing I learned in this process was understanding that this new reality offered me two options: Either succumb to oppression involving the above identities or take them on with pride and courage. One of the major impacts so far this experience has had on my participation in the second cohort is that it has made me think more about my work, including my motives, learning, experiences, expectations and vision. There is still a lacking gender analysis that recognizes the differences in roles among women, men and transgender people in society, the differences between the positions of power and opportunities assigned by society to each one of those groups and the needs of each group and how their differences impact the lives of everyone. The organization has focused its work on the need for people directly affected to be part of the decision-making process and to be clear on how gender, class and race differences impact the decisions made. And as a survivor of sexual and physical violence that did not speak English fluently, I had to learn to overcome my barriers to fully being a part of the new society of which I now belonged. With the rising incidents of sexual assault and gender discrimination in South Florida, I have been called to help facilitate and establish processes and protocols within movement organizations and leaders. Over time, I realized this was not the fault of the members directly but that the organization itself did not have an operating system to address gender differences internally or in the community at large. Hopefully, this process leads toward a transformation in the way that social justice organizations deal with gender issues within their organizations, staff and membership.",1,1

Whether Ruszkowski is bowing to political pressure to water down the science curriculum that New Mexico teachers will deliver to students or simply doesnt believe in climate change, evolution or scientific dating processes his recommendations are deeply troubling and take New Mexico in the wrong direction for education and the new economy. In 2013, the PEDs own Math and Science Advisory Council unanimously supported adoption of the Next Generation Science Standards as written without any modifications, but former education Secretary Hanna Skandera never acted on the recommendation. To make matters worse, Ruszkowski trots out these clearly unscientific recommendations as educators and employers push hard for STEM courses in our public schools, and years into an administration that has fought to adjust teaching requirements so more professional scientists and mathematicians can lead K-12 classrooms. Among the changes the PED proposes are: eliminating a reference to Earths 4.6-billion-year history and replacing it with geologic history in the middle-school curriculum; omitting a reference to a rise in global temperatures and replacing it with fluctuations in temperature; and omitting the word evolution and replacing it with the phrase biological diversity. But a diversity of perspectives belongs in sociology or theology class it runs counter to the scientific process that, through experimentation and verification, turns theory into accepted fact or fiction, not something in between. We are flummoxed over why a department that stresses data-driven results, even to the point of antagonizing many constituents, would ignore data to suggest such changes.

He and his team chose to locate offices in Singapore, Parker says, because theyre convinced it will be the first country that will adopt autonomous cars at scale. Singapores rigid government known to be cagey even about banal matters hasnt revealed how much has been spent toward advancing driverless car research. They have brashly predicted that theyll outpace the rest of the world putting everyday commuters in robot cars. But given Singapores tiny size and enthusiastic officials, the city-state could get the jump on other nations and act as the worlds robot car guinea pig. Google says its gravely disappointed with these plans and accuses California authorities of writing a ceiling on the potential for fully self-driving cars. Initially, Parker says, the island would see driverless shuttles taking commuters to train stops from outlying neighborhoods where taxis seldom venture. Were making a big bet on Singapore, says Doug Parker, chief operating officer of nuTonomy, a startup that develops software for self-driving cars. But that doesnt mean California will see everyday commuters in driverless cars any time soon. They hope to offer robot cars to Singapores public in the next 12 to 24 months.

If I have one criticism, I think it's that they didn't declassify more of the information before Obama left office, in order to keep it from being buried by the illegitimately elected administration controlling its disposition now. But, you may ask, what about the election that was going on at the same time the Obama administration was retaliating for Russian interference in its process? What Comey did may be even worse, because he not only permitted foreign aggression to continue undisclosed, but also inserted himself and the FBI into the election in a different way but with the same goal: To tilt the result toward Donald Trump. Did Obama Choke On Russian Election Interference?.This Washington Post report about the struggle inside the White House is huge, comprehensive, detailed, and raises some serious questions. While I agree with Pierce that we had an absolute right to know, I cannot envision the scenario where our media and our political establishment acknowledge that this is an attack on our country, just without bombs, because key players would not actually speak the truth. However, like so many things about the Obama administration, the response to what the Russians did was measured and allegedly proportional. It begins with a delivery to the White House early last August, limited to four pairs of eyes: Inside was an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Russian President Vladimir Putins direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the U.S. presidential race. The idea that the Obama administration withheld the fact that the Russians were ratfcking the election in order to help elect a vulgar talking yam is a terrible condemnation of the whole No Drama Obama philosophy.

Butterfly, which recently opened on Broadway with Clive Owen in the cast, has set its closing date, with producers announcing the show will go dark in January after a run of middling sales weeks. The play, about a French diplomats affair with a mysterious Chinese performer, also touches on gender identity issues that still resonate today, and the new production incorporates some significant changes that playwright David Henry Hwang made to his original script, which played Broadway in a two-year run that began in 1988. Backers of the production had hoped to catch the attention of Broadway theatergoers with Owen on the marquee and the Broadway return of Taymor, whose staging of The Lion King just turned 20. Nelle Nugent leads a producing team that also includes Steve Traxler, Kenneth Teaton, Benjamin Feldman,Doug Morris, In Fine Company, Jim Kierstead, Hunter Arnold, Spencer Ross and Jam Theatricals in association with Alix L.

Rejecting qualified black girls who want to be in sororities because they are black is something you would think wouldnt happen these days. It also should be pointed out that all of the white members who for 50 years kikid it up with their sorority sisters seemed to be unaware until now that there were zero black people among them.

I dont think South Sudan has a better friend than the United States, Kerry responded, adding that if the nations leaders continue to fail on delivering its commitments in the peace agreement, the international community is absolutely prepared for individual sanctions. But various advocacy groups and some in Congress believe that far more forceful US#160;action is required, especially against Kiir and the sitting government; they have repeatedly cited tougher sanctions and an arms embargo as potential tools to address the conflict in South Sudan. At an appropriations hearing in February, Rooney asked Secretary of State John Kerry about US#160;plans with the international community to impose such an arms embargo and tougher sanctions on individuals whove committed violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in South Sudan. Steve Pruitt, a senior partner at Watts Partners who worked with South Sudan, said the goal of the contract was to help the government develop and increase communications with U.S. policymakers concerning humanitarian aid and peace talks. Shortly after South Sudan gained independence, then-secretary Clinton welcomed the new government, saying, We will work with you, we will stand with you, we will support you.

On much of the U.S. television coverage, the threats are virtually all coming from one side, without any explanation, and the United States is merely on the scene to bring down the level of tension.#160; As ABCs Raddatz (3/31/13) explained: The U.S., which launched two nuclear-capable B-2 stealth bombers last week to carry out a practice bombing run less than 50 miles from North Korea, says it will continue to respond to provocation. Again, the standard is pretty clear: Statements by North Korea says are threatening provocations, while when the U.S. pretends to drop nuclear bombs just across your border, well, thats just how you respond to provocation. Ostensibly a defensive exercise in preparation for an attack by the north, the joint U.S./South Korea war games have taken on a decidedly offensive characteristic since Kim Jong Ils death. In other words, there are some real world events that might bother North Koreas leadershipno matter what one might think about the level of North Korean paranoia. And I have to say from watching North Koreas evening news broadcasts for the past week or so, the North Korean media are not quite as wrapped up in this war mood as one might think. While North Koreas apparent threats are obviously troubling, one doesnt have to be paranoid to take offense at those military drills. He was quoted by a New York Times blog (Lede, 3/29/13): We need to keep in mind that North and South Korea are not so much trading outright threats as trading blustering vows of how they would retaliate if attacked. North Korea appears to want to pick a fight and the U.S. says if it comes to that, it is ready.

As a child, Skorka said his father talked about how Jews had been persecuted over the centuries, including at times by the Catholic Church, but also emphasized the links between Judaism and Christianity. Skorka said the pope is so comfortable with Jewish culture that as he vetted meals at the Vatican hotel to make sure the rabbi was given only kosher food, Francis joked he was the rabbis personal mashgiach, the Hebrew word for a supervisor in a restaurant or other business who oversees compliance with Jewish dietary laws. Skorka said the two men plan to see each other again in January, when Francis is scheduled to meet in Rome with Argentine Jewish leaders. Skorka said he hopes to pray with the pope before Jerusalems Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, and in Bethlehem, to show the world it is possible. But, Jewish leaders say, this is the first pope so personally involved with Jews before he was elected. He is receiving very, very harsh criticism from people who dont like a pope without red shoes, and a pope who speaks to people in a very simple and direct language, and a pope who will transmit to people that he is close to them, that he in some way hugs them through jokes and through simple words and through simple expressions, Skorka said. Days passed without any word from Francis, although the pope had already started making the informal telephone calls from the Vatican that drew so much attention. ADVERTISEMENT Skorka doesnt remember exactly how his conversations with Bergoglio began, but the two had come to know each other through the citys religious events. But more than that, Skorka said they were united in trying to reach people who had fallen away from their own religions and instead worshipped what the rabbi calls the idols of money, power and sex.

California Rejects Settlement Over Alleged Foreclosure Abuses.California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris pulled out Friday of state and US efforts to negotiate an end to the government's investigation of alleged foreclosure abuses, calling the proposed settlement ""inadequate for California homeowners."" Continue Reading Below Some state and federal officials had been seeking as much as $25 billion in penalties that would be used, in part, to write down loan balances for underwater borrowers. ""It became clear to me that California was being asked for a broader release of claims than we can accept and to excuse conduct that has not been adequately investigated,"" she said.She added that ""the relief contemplated would allow too few California homeowners to stay in their homes."" In a letter sent Friday to Associate US Attorney General Thomas Perrelli and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who have been leading the negotiations, Harris said her decision to break off from the group was driven by two key concerns. In recent months, attorneys general in New York, Massachusetts, Delaware, Nevada, Minnesota and Kentucky have also expressed concerns about a potential settlement. Foreclosures in California and other states had plummeted in the wake of the robo-signing scandal, but recently began to increase as banks worked through their paperwork problems. One key point of contention has been the extent to which banks should be released from additional legal claims in exchange for signing on to an agreement. But it will be difficult to come close to that amount without the participation of California. California has more underwater borrowers than any other state and has more borrowers that are behind on their mortgages or in foreclosure than any other state but Florida.

Several members of the right-leaning Likud have openly expressed their skepticism about the talks, which the Palestinians agreed to only after Netanyahu got his cabinet to agree to the release of 104 Palestinian prisoners. Unless Israeli settlement building is halted, he wrote, it is hard to see how negotiations can produce a peace agreement. It's sure to provoke a clash between moderate factions who support the renewed peace talks, including Justice Minister Tsipi Livni, who is Israel's chief negotiator, and most of Netanyahu's own party. It announced its decision despite the recent resumption of US-sponsored peace talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, three years after they stalled. The recent",0,2

If there was an agency that could be consulted by military contractors on the social implications of certain kinds of robots entering the battlefield, they could avoid deploying the kind that might introduce such a dire predicament.Not only could the agency advise companies and lawmakers on their decisions in relation to robots, but it could help foster growth in robotics, Calo argues. He argues that an agency that could gather the foremost experts on robotics and technology related to robotics, much like NASA and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) have done in their fields, could change the way the United States deals with issues and concepts related to future robotic endeavors. Thats also a big problem, because we cant have car companies wasting money and NASAs time looking into matters that have nothing to do with NASA specialists areas of expertise theyre kind of busy trying to figure out how the universe was created and if we can live on other planets. At times when it is clear there needs to be immediate action on creating laws for how a new technology is handled, like commercial drones, the government too often makes broad decisions without much expert insight. He knows that some people would rather the government stay away from these technologies entirely, but the law is eventually going to get involved, whether its for intellectual property, licensing or privacy; the law is not going to entirely leave robotics alone, nor would it leave any human activity alone. He doesnt think we need some giant bureaucratic regulator that says what everyone can and cant do and pursues rule breakers; rather, we need an agency thats there when we have questions and that pools resources to further advancement.

5231,"However, since deportation is technically a regulatory procedure and not a punitive procedure, non-citizens do not have the right to contest their deportation in the same way they would had they been accused of a crime. Insofar as deportation is often experienced as punishment, courts must take the matter more seriously and allow non-citizens to present more evidence against their deportation than has been the case, especially since the implementation of the 1996 laws. As deportation is not punishment, the United States government is not violating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) that both indicates that a person should not be punished twice for the same crime and that people should not be discriminated against because of their national origin. Deportation Feels Like Punishment Nearly all of the 156 deportees that I have interviewed over the last year in four countries felt as though their deportation was punishment, either for being in the US illegally or for committing a crime. My research makes it clear that non-citizens in the United States often feel as if they are treated like criminals even if the laws indicate that they are not criminals but immigration violators. Should we believe the legal documents that allow one to argue that no human rights treaties are being violated or should we listen to the experiences of people who feel that they are treated as criminals? However, undocumented migrants are treated like criminals; detainees feel as if they are in prison; and deportees experience their exclusion as punishment. A person is undocumented if they have violated provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by overstaying their visa, entering the United States without inspection, ignoring a deportation order, or something similar. People who face deportation are not given the same constitutional protections given to suspected criminals. For example, if a citizen and a non-citizen both shoplift $900 worth of clothes and both are sentenced to 18 months in prison, the citizen goes free after serving her time, yet the non-citizen is detained and faces deportation after serving her time.

During the first day of the operation, the most complex for Iraqs military since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011, Kurdish forces say they retook nine villages and pushed the frontline back eight kilometers (five miles). They spent their lives in these tunnels, said Tahseen Muhammed Sharif, a 35-year-old Kurdish fighter who said the Kurdish forces who drove the militants out of the village also found ammunition inside the tunnel network, which they seized. When Iraqi forces reach Mosul, Patrick Martin of the Institute for the Study of War in Washington said they should expect to see similar complex defenses like the tunnel networks and booby-trapped explosives in Badana, but on a much greater scale. A small unit of Iraqi Kurdish fighters tasked with holding the territory in and around Badana, were camped Tuesday in a field behind a row of armored vehicles on the villages edge. In the center of the village on Tuesday, a group of Kurdish fighters gathered around the bodies of two IS militants killed in an airstrike a day earlier, some crouching down to snap selfies. After a string of victories over the past year, Iraqi ground forces have pushed IS out of more than half the territory the group once held in Iraq, with close support from the U.S.-led coalition. When IS fighters moved into the territory around Mosul more than two years ago, the group attacked with convoys that traversed the open desert and held parades in the city center. Now, faced with punishing airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition, the fighters have been forced to change tactics, melting into civilian populations and building networks of tunnels under residential areas so they could move without being seen from above.

The team heads into Thursdays Europa League game against Southampton bottom of its group without a point after two losses. Although revenue is forecast to break the 200 million-euro barrier this season, that is only a third of Manchester Uniteds 2016-17 target, one of the biggest in soccer. The gulf in the clubs moneymaking abilities reflects just how far Serie A lags the English Premier League, after being the dominant competition in Europe at the end of the last century. You arent going to be able to do that if you compromised your technical squad because a signing would be good for sponsorship. As European clubs, its very hard in Asia unless you have a bridgehead, opening doors, Bolingbroke said.

The impact is commensurately shocking, with 600,000 children younger than 5 across the world dying every year from air pollution-related diseases, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said in the report released Monday. Another 520 million children are breathing toxic air in Africa, and 450 million in East Asia, mainly China, according to the report, which combined satellite images of pollution and ground data with demographic patterns to determine which populations fell into the highest risk areas. Last week, the city launched a smartphone application called Change the Air inviting residents to send photos and complaints about illegal pollution sources, from the burning of leaves and garbage in public parks to construction crews working without dust control measures.

It was a sign of whats to come as Hillary sets herself up for a presidential run down the road, where alleged antiwar groups like MoveOn.org will likely rush to defend Hillary against a Republican challenger, despite her deadly foreign policy positions. Thats the futility of running antiwar campaigns in Democratic primaries against party elites like Hillary Clinton. Besides, only Democrats in New York can vote in the primaries, which in this case would ignore the fact that the antiwar movement is more diverse than just grassroots Democrats. And that raises the question: why even run antiwar campaigns inside the Democratic Party like Tasini is trying to do? If the antiwar movement were politically savvy theyd be thinking ahead to Hillary Clintons expected run for president in 2008. There is absolutely no question Hillary Clinton doesnt want a debate on the war, says Tasini. Perhaps the worst of the Democrats still embracing the illegal war is Senator Hillary Clinton. On June 3 Clinton won the coveted ballot line of the Working Families Party in New York, even though the WFP was one of the first to oppose the war on Iraq four years ago. Late last month at the New York Democrats state convention, Tasini failed to introduce an antiwar resolution that would have called for an immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq.

Green and other former teachers are guiding rookies at 80 schools through the Retired Mentors Program, a two-year-old partnership with the Chicago chapter of the National Retired Teachers Association, the educator wing of (and precursor to) the American Association of Retired Persons, which pays some of the costs. Karen Cushing, program coordinator for the CPS Department of Learning and Development, notes that some new teachers from the schools served in 2004 quit before mentoring got underway. So far, according to a report from the national teachers group, a university survey found that 75 percent of participating new teachers say they benefited from the program.

Clearly, Japan is champing at the bit to buy this plane -- and where Japan leads, the hope is that other buyers will follow. Advertisement Last month, in one of its regular ""notifications"" to Congress, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) announced that the Government of Japan has requested permission to buy four KC-46A ""Pegasus"" aerial refueling aircraft from Boeing. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! It's not, however, a good reason to buy Boeing stock in and of itself.

552,"Army officials requested industrys help earlier this month, saying the growing use of tunnels and underground facilities by military and irregular forces to gain a tactical advantage is becoming more sophisticated and increasingly effective, making the likelihood of U.S. forces encountering military-purposed subterranean structures on future battlefields high. But the practice may be contributing to a new trend: foreign militaries and insurgents are using tunnels and other underground networks more and more to hide and gain a tactical advantage and that increases the likelihood that U.S. forces will face them below ground in the future. The U.S. Army just issued a warning about tunnel warfare as part of a new effort seeking high-tech robotics, communications gear and other equipment. In South Korea, military officials fear their North Korean counterparts have dug a series of deep tunnels that will allow them to invade their U.S.-aligned neighbor. In southern Afghanistan, Taliban fighters have used them to hide weapons and to disappear after ambushing U.S. forces. The Army did not identify any specific country in which they expect tunnel warfare will occur, but said the Middle East is full of ancient and modern underground systems that can be used by enemy forces. And in Mexico, tunnels under the U.S. border are used to smuggle in massive quantities of cocaine and marijuana. Examples include Syria, where rebels have used them extensively; Iraq, where they are rumored to stretch for miles; and Egypt, where the military flooded many of them with sewage earlier this year, before President Mohammed Morsi was removed from power.

""Republicans hold an advantage on this issue among people who feel strongly about it,"" said Robert Blendon of the Harvard School of Public Health, who follows opinion trends on health care. On the other hand, he's been able to slash what his family pays for health insurance by purchasing coverage through the law's new insurance markets and by taking advantage of tax credits to lower the premiums. Poll: Little love for Obamacare..................................................................................................................................................................................... A new Associated Press-GfK poll finds that public opinion continues to run deeply negative on the Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature effort to cover the uninsured. The pattern illustrates why the health care law remains a favored target for Republicans seeking a Senate majority in the midterm elections. Kulik says he doesn't believe the federal government should require people to carry health insurance, as the law does. For the White House, it's an uncomfortable reminder of the technical problems that paralyzed the HealthCare.gov website for weeks after it went live last fall.

Two years later, the real estate bubble had popped and Gluck, after nearly doubling Rivertons debt load, was unable to raise rents enough to cover the payments. (Levy even knows of one development where residents, many of them city employees, are being driven out by real estate companies financed by their own pension funds.) Deals by Gluck and other big players have stripped the equity from many of New Yorks developments; roughly 70,000 affordable units are overleveraged, says Dina Levy, a tenant organizer with the citys Urban Homesteading Assistance Board. It all sounds like a classic tale of the bust except that, unlike ordinary people caught up in foreclosure proceedings, Gluck and his partners have made a fortune off Riverton Houses. In fact, even as he haggles with mortgage holder Wells Fargo over the Riverton mortgage, Gluck has been negotiating to buy at least two other housing developmentsBrooklyns Tivoli Towers and Castleton Park on Staten Island. A homeowner would be on the hook for that extra cash, but Glucks group purchased Riverton through a limited liability shell company, which allows it to shelter its refinancing windfall in case of a default.

5478,"The Supreme Court opinion suggests that strict compliance with the rule dealing with pretrial release has been less than enthusiastic in trial courts across the state, although it notes empirical studies have found that the severity of the charge isnt a predictor of flight risk or reoffending by a pretrial defendant. The opinion signals a potential crackdown on trial courts that arent following an established rule saying defendants are entitled to bail under the least restrictive conditions available. Judges cant use exorbitant bond setting to keep a criminal defendant in jail pending trial at least not if theyre doing their jobs, the New Mexico Supreme Court said Thursday in a landmark opinion on bail. The Supreme Court said there may be blowback from adherence to the rule, especially since some of the public may have the mistaken impression that money bonds should be imposed based solely on the nature of the charged crime. The high court faulted the absence of written reasons for the judges denial of a request for some form of release, especially given unrefuted testimony that the defendant was likely to be compliant with terms set by the judge. Intentionally setting bail so high as to be unattainable is simply a less honest method of unlawfully denying bail altogether, says the 47-page opinion by Justice Charles Daniels for a unanimous court. ADVERTISEMENT The opinion promises amended procedures to ensure that anyone facing a life sentence can appeal directly to the Supreme Court, bypassing the Court of Appeals. Instead, they must individually tailor the least restrictive conditions that will assure community safety and the defendants presence at trial, the court said. We understand that this case may not be an isolated instance and that other judges may be imposing bonds based solely on the nature of the charged offense without regard to individual determinations of flight risk or continued danger to the community, the opinion says. The prosecution argued in Browns case that the $250,000 bond should stay in place because of the serious nature of the charges, and outlined facts of the case for both courts. The court has a duty to tailor the conditions of pretrial release to the needs and risks posed by each individual defendant",0,0

ADVERTISEMENT Brian Moore, the attorney representing the three faculty members who raised concerns about Valencia, said his clients would not comment on the universitys decision to cut his contract short. Provost Chaouki Abdallah told the Journal on Thursday that he reviewed Valencias case and decided to terminate the tenure-track professor, following the recommendation of Dean Mark Peceny of the College of Arts and Sciences earlier this year. The university also confirmed at the time that another anthropology professor, Erin Debenport, had left the university for a job at UCLA. His attorney, Michael Mozes, told the Journal that he didnt have a comment on the provosts decision at this time. The decision on Cristobal Valencia follows an earlier decision that he only be censured, which would have allowed him back into the classroom. The firing comes after three other anthropology professors quit teaching classes in the fall semester after complaining to UNM about initially keeping Valencia. The contentious, nearly half-year-long case of an anthropology professor accused of sexually harassing students is nearly over with the University of New Mexicos choosing to terminate his contract. He was accused of making lewd comments about his students, touching them inappropriately and at one point saying he didnt take orders from white bitches, according to complaints filed with the school. An Office of Equal Opportunity investigation earlier this year found probable cause that Valencia made lewd comments about students, inappropriately touched students and cultivated relationships with female students that could lead to sex. A person who answered the phone in the anthropology department Thursday told the Journal that Valencia was not in the office.

When you can point out to students these foods are grown locally or in the region, more kids are willing to try that, Concannon said, adding that buying locally also helps growers and ranchers. With population diminishing, schools are reinvesting in local farms and thats a good thing, he said. This year, we were able to get cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, sweet bell peppers, tomatoes and watermelons from farms in New Mexico, said Suzanne Bryant, dietician for the Farmington Municipal School District.

12661,"The evidence so far indicates that Israel: * established legitimate grounds for Hizbullahs attack on the border post by refusing to withdraw from the Lebanese territory of the Shebaa Farms in 2000; * initiated a war of aggression be refusing to engage in talks about a prisoner swap offered by Hizbullah; * committed a grave war crime by intentionally using cluster bombs against south Lebanons civilians; * repeatedly hit Lebanese communities, killing many civilians, even though the evidence is that no Hizbullah fighters were to be found there; * and put its own civilians, especially Arab civilians, in great danger by making their communities targets for Hizbullah attacks and failing to protect them. Another claim, one that Israel hoped might justify the large number of Lebanese civilians it killed during the war, was that Hizbullah fighters had been regularly hiding and firing rockets from among south Lebanons civilian population. During the war Israel used this to advantageous effect: for example, it was widely reported that a Hizbullah rocket fell close to a hospital but reporters failed to mention that a large army camp was next to it. As a result, Haaretz noted that Israeli commanders had issued a warning to Lebanon that in future hostilities the army will not hesitate to bomb and even totally destroy urban areas after it gives Lebanese civilians the chance to flee. As a first-hand observer of the fighting from Israels side of the border last year, I noted on several occasions that Israel had built many of its permanent military installations, including weapons factories and army camps, and set up temporary artillery positions next to and in some cases inside civilian communities in the north of Israel. In many cases it is still not possible to specify where Hizbullah rockets landed because Israels military censor prevents any discussion that might identify the location of a military site. How this would diverge from Israels policy during the war, when Hizbullah was based in its nature reserves but Lebanese civilians were still bombed in their towns and villages, was not made clear. The Association has looked at northern Arab communities hit by Hizbullah rockets, often repeatedly, and found that",1,1
7445,"As fear-stricken citizens throughout the world surrender their personal rights to their fear-stricken governments in the name of safeguarding their personal security, which in turn surrender their soverieignty to faceless agencies like the WTO in the name of economic security, we might recall Gandhis words, Fearlessness is the first attribute of spirituality. This made some sense to many in view of the vicissitudes and general caprice of feudal rule in pre-British India, until Gandhi gently reminded us that good governance was no substitute for self governance. Like Jefferson, Gandhi too believed in small government, writing that, that government is best which governs least. He genuinely thought that Gandhis contribution was merely in freeing the country from the British, while Singh, the Indian finance minister who had freed the Indian Economy from governmental shackles in the early 90s, thus ushering India into the global economy, was clearly the larger figure. There are numerous personal characteristics of Gandhia prodigious courage both physical and political, enormous self-discipline, asceticism and industry (over a hundred volumes of writings and 20-hour days), a fine sense of humor and the ability to mock himselfall interesting and formidable qualities which must have played a major role in the making of the Mahatma. Without a Gandhi, India might well have ended up like Pakistan, a hotbed of intolerance and obscurantism (it may be pure coincidence that the more India rejects Gandhi, thats exactly where it seems headed!). Let us turn the searchlight inward, he once said, to the astonishment of a crowd which had come expecting some rousing rhetoric condemning the British, only to find him spouting uncomfortable home truths about how Indians themselves enabled British rule in a hundred small ways. But if I were to condense his political philosophy into one phrase, it would be thisthe freedom of the individual. It is almost certainly owing to Gandhis movement that India, for all its flaws, has remained a liberal democracy (no other country freed from the colonial yoke can make this claim).

10713,"Even a doubling of promotional and marketing costs wasn't enough to stem the tide, and as Motley Fool contributor John Maxfield noted last month, some fear that Chipotle is moving away from the business model that made it a success Opens a New Window. Chipotle could end up being a huge winner if it can successfully turn around its business, but there are a lot more questions than answers about the fast-casual company right now. Advertisement Things look a little better when you turn to earnings projections for the immediate future, but there's still a wide gulf between the two stocks. You might expect that Chipotle would look cheaper than McDonald's after seeing its stock drop so sharply. Moves like adding desserts, turning to television advertising, and using data analytics to assess its business mark major departures from its simple way of doing business in the past -- and shareholders don't seem optimistic about the eventual results. For McDonald's, the introduction of all-day breakfast and focused promotional offers to customers have led to rising sales, with improving customer perceptions of the fast-food giant and stronger figures on the top and bottom lines. Investors looking for stocks in the consumer space are curious whether Chipotle or McDonald's is a better bet right now. Even with Chipotle's poor stock performance, McDonald's still looks cheaper on basic valuation. Even taking into account the difference in their relative size, McDonald's is better about being shareholder-friendly with its capital than Chipotle. In its most recent quarter, net income plunged 95% from year-ago levels, with same-store sales plummeting an incredible 22% despite Chipotle's best efforts to keep customers coming through its doors. Chipotle currently trades at a whopping 160 times its earnings over the past 12 months, compared to a much more pedestrian trailing earnings multiple of 23 for McDonald's. At least so far, five consecutive quarters of positive comparable-restaurant sales point to a nice rebound for McDonald's.",1,3
10582,"""I think in the opening days, he's going to repeal 60 to 70 percent of Obama's legacy by simply vetoing out all of the various executive orders that Obama used because he couldn't get anything through Congress,"" Gingrich said according to The Washington Times. According to Gingrich, who ran for president under the Republican Party in 2012, Trump may dissolve as much as 70 percent of the executive orders implemented by Obama. This, of course, goes against what Obama actually did in his administration by bypassing Congress to enact his various executive orders. During one of these sessions, Obama advised Trump to seek the approval of Congress in enacting polices since these will be harder to undo once they pass. Former House Speaker Newt Gringrich predicted that President-elect Donald Trump will take about majority of the executive orders issued by Barack Obama after he assumes office in January. Unlike Obama, Trump will probably not have a hard time passing new polices through Congress since majority of the seats in the House are now occupied by members of the Republican Party. Since many of these were passed without the approval of Congress, and that some do not benefit the majority, Trump could very repeal many of these orders. Following the election, Obama met with Trump on multiple occasions to reportedly discuss future policies of the incoming administration. This means that through majority support, Trump will not have to resort to issuing executive orders in carrying out most of his policies. As noted by Gingrich, Trump may consider this action because many of these EOs were made without the approval of Congress. Newt Gringrich Predicts Trump Will Dissolve 70% of Obama's Executive Orders.

14098,"SPECIAL MENTION: When Air Force blocked a Justus Adams point-after attempt after the Lobos fourth touchdown Friday, it appeared special teams might be a contributor to UNMs seventh loss of the season. Air Force coach Troy Calhoun, in comments from an Associated Press story, said the former Cleveland Storm star reminded him of 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow with his size (6-foot-4, 223 pounds) and when you meet the kid, hes a huge young man. THE POWER OF URL: Lobos running back Kasey Carrier said he drew inspiration from a pregame visit to the team from former UNM all-time great and Chicago Bears All-Pro Brian Urlacher. Early in the fourth quarter, Lobo defensive end Fatu Ulale blocked an Air Force point-after that would have tied the game at 35. Later, Adams hit a 24-yard field goal that gave UNM a two-score lead (45-34) then made a touchdown-saving tackle on the ensuing kickoff return. But he played every snap in the second half, during which he ran 11 yards for a touchdown and hit tight end Andrew Aho in the corner of the end zone for what could have been a crucial two-point conversion. The UNM sophomore rushed for 140 yards on 20 carries, threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Jeric Magnant for the games first score and ran the Lobos option-based offense to near-perfection. The Lobos also recovered a surprise onside kick after the Falcons had tied the game at 21 early in the third quarter.

Gay activist and former D.C. resident Peter Schott, who lives fulltime in Rehoboth but, like Rosenstein, resides outside the city limits and is ineligible to vote, said Kuhns victory didnt surprise him. Lesbian administrator Lisa Schlosser, a former military intelligence officer who recently worked in high-level positions in the federal government under the Obama administration, won election to the Rehoboth Board of Commissioners, which serves as the citys legislative body. A controversial construction project for a new City Hall that has resulted in a large cost overrun has loomed above most other issues for LGBT voters along with their straight counterparts, observers said. Prior to moving to Rehoboth full time in 2005 Kuhns worked for 25 years as an investment banker with Merrill Lynch in New York, where he headed a division specializing in municipal finance. A lot of people said this was it for Cooper, Schott said in referring to the controversy over the City Hall project in which many voting residents expressed anger over an expected $3.5 million cost overrun for the project. Until recently, many voters believed the city was well run, Cooper was doing a good job, and there was no need to elect someone else, according to many familiar with Rehoboth politics. The official vote count released on the Rehoboth Beach city website shows that 1,706 registered voters cast their ballots in the Aug. 12 election, with 879 voting in the single polling place at the city fire house on Election Day and 436 voting by absentee ballot. Kuhns argued that the mayor was running the city largely on a year to year basis and had not worked as well as he should have with the city manager to develop a long range plan that, if put in place years earlier, could have averted the cost overruns.

Of course she was, Bill, because she can't tell YOUR producer to put up clips that make you look bad. And she joins Bill Kristol and other beltway GOP trough eaters in wishing the media would ignore Trump and let them cash in on both siderism in peace! Not that most of the time I think Jennifer Rubin shouldn't have that platform, but when Conservative Mommy and Conservative Daddy are fighting and Mommy has had it with Donald Trump, you have to take Mom's side, don't you? Your own newspaper posted a headline that said, ""the O'Reilly-Trump interviews are the best Trump interviews."" I guess Bill O'Reilly doesn't realize that Jennifer Rubin's ""website"" is The Washington Post. O'REILLY: Go ahead, and you know how many people are going to come to your website? It's presented as a news program, or a pseudo-news program, and instead, it's a lot of parroting what Trump is saying to you. JENNIFER RUBIN: No, my criticism is really that you actually are in the spin zone. So Rubin ended it: RUBIN: You know what I'll do, Bill?",1,1

Under its reorganization plan, the insurer will create a new holding company, which will own Genworth and the U.S. and European MI units. Genworth Takes Steps to Isolate Mortgage Insurance Business.Genworth Financial Inc said it would take steps to distance itself from its troubled mortgage insurance business, following investor demands to spin off the unit, sending its shares up 11 percent. The European units will provide about $200 million in additional statutory capital to the U.S. mortgage business. Genworth's new plan, disclosed a month after it named former ING executive Thomas McInerney as chief executive, transfers the ownership of the company's European MI subsidiaries to the U.S. MI unit.

1440,"Second: Since the bulk of union membership consists of full-time workers with stable contracts and quite well paid by comparison with the average income (especially in the Kingdom of Spain where unemployment is a chronic 19.4%), they could lose out economically because of the tax reforms required to finance the Basic Income. Its true that workers receiving a Basic Income would have more leeway for deciding as individuals when their working conditions are intolerable but this doesnt mean that the unions collective muscle would be weakened. The argument that bosses will use Basic Income as an excuse to lower wages echoes the reasoning used to explain the opposition of some Italian union members to a national minimum wage (though this view is not only not shared by unionists in states where this does exist but is fiercely rebutted). voluntary work and domestic (reproductive) work, a standpoint which makes it impossible to understand the effects a Basic Income would have for most people. The claim about destroying welfare services has become so widespread and has often become so mischievous that at the last BIEN International Congress (Seoul 2016), the following resolution was passed, amending the statutes so that they now state: A majority of members attending BIENs General Assembly meeting in Seoul on July 9, 2016, agreed to support a Basic Income that is stable in size and frequency and high enough to be, in combination with other social services, part of a policy strategy to eliminate material poverty and enable the social and cultural participation of every individual. And the firm floor provided by the basic income makes for a more fluid back and forth between employment, training and family that should reduce the occurrence of burnout and early retirement, thus enabling people to spread employment over a longer portion of their lives. To such end, the right to an unconditional, regular, monetary income paid by the state and financed by fiscal reforms, is recognised as a right of citizenship, to each resident member of society, independently of their other sources of income, and being adequate to allow them to cover their basic needs.

906,"Your property tax bite..................................................................................................................................................................................... Albuquerque is home to the highest property tax rate in New Mexico about double Santa Fes and many homeowners have seen their bills grow at nearly twice the rate of inflation since 2004. Instead, much of the increase comes from an almost automatic bump of 3 percent a year in many homes assessed value on the tax rolls. In the citys basic taxing district, for example, the tax bill for a home thats now on the books at $200,000 ran about $225 a month last year, compared to roughly $165 a decade ago, if you factor in changes to both the homes assessed value and tax rates. Many people have seen their annual property tax bill grow well beyond the rate of inflation over time. Thats due to the 2001 state law that says a homes value on the tax rolls can climb only up to 3 percent a year, unless the property changes ownership. Add it all up, and plenty of people have seen their annual property tax bill grow well beyond the rate of inflation over the last 10 years. You might see increased pressure on property taxes outside Bernalillo County because the gross receipts tax has been over-relied upon, said Richard Anklam, president and executive director of the New Mexico Tax Research Institute. That means a homes value for tax purposes can climb, even if its actual market value falls in a given year. Bernalillo County, for example, plans to ask voters this fall for a property tax increase that would generate $2.8 million to pay for buying and maintaining open-space land. Take the example of a home near the University of New Mexico north campus, in the largest taxing district in Albuquerque, on the tax rolls at roughly $159,000, paying taxes to seven different agencies, including the flood-control authority. Of course, tax officials could also argue that, despite the increase, home owners in this situation still arent paying what they should.

Constantly traveling with women from sub-Saharan Africa, sharing time with each evening around biblical stories it made you feel so much more connected, she said. She came back committed to finding Alliance churches and ministries willing to provide people, funds and materials to help immigrants who are in limbo in Morocco. As a result, there are now about a dozen Baptists committed to urging their American churches, communities and politicians to support policies to help the nation model for the rest of the world how it treats those#160;who are economically, and sometimes sexually, enslaved. Some KBF congregations have established sister relationships with churches in Morocco, while others work directly at the national level there by aiding refugees, illegal immigrants and victims of human trafficking, said Joshua Speight, associate coordinator for missions for KBF. The October trip arranged by the Kentucky Baptist Fellowship also showed participants that the causes and consequences of illegal immigration are not just an American issue. The immigration issue is one of the reasons KBF wanted to partner with churches in Morocco, Joshua Speight said. Most of the women there are not Moroccan, but students and workers from other parts of Africa who are living legally in Morocco, Speight said. It was in these intimate settings that the KBF-led caravan members were reminded of the Moroccan churchs struggle to minister to refugees and illegal immigrants who are languishing in that country. Those women come from Christian backgrounds that are theologically diverse and often divided on the issue of women in ministry, he added. Another congregation, Highland Baptist Church in Louisville, works directly with a national aid group in Morocco that provides ministry and assistance directly to refugees and immigrants.

A measure of underlying demand in the factory sector, which strips out aircraft and military goods and is a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, advanced 1.2%, a faster clip than analysts had expected. Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in April, a sign of resilience in the factory sector despite belt-tightening in Washington and weakness in overseas markets. Financial data firm Markit said on Thursday its preliminary factory purchasing managers' index hit a seven-month low in May. The strength in overall new orders was broad based, from transportation to machinery and electronics, running counter to recent signs of weakness in the factory sector. However, shipments of these core capital goods, which go into calculations of equipment and software spending in the gross domestic product report, fell 1.5%. The department also revised prior readings for orders to show a smaller decline in March than previously estimated. That suggests business spending got off to a weak start in the second quarter, and could reinforce expectations that economic growth will slow during the period.

In case you werent around in the 80s, corporate executives and business leaders were generally slow to adapt to changing market conditions and new technology. I mean, how many failures does it take to realize youre incompetent? Its often said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Back in the day we used to measure success by how big our organizations were. By the same token, a lot of what passes for conventional leadership wisdom these days is nothing but popular fads and feel-good fluff.",1,3

3896,"We sent them a letter explaining how continuing to accommodate students by giving them major religious holidays off does not violate the Constitution and is actually encouraged under state law. More Universities Cancel Religious Holidays.A string of universities in the State University of New York (SUNY) system have recently removed religious holidays from their academic schedule. While these universities, like most SUNY universities, have traditionally given students the day off for major Jewish and Christian holidays, such as those surrounding Easter and Passover, they have now removed these religious holidays from the Universitys academic calendar. As we told SUNY Albany in a letter, This is an unnecessary, ill-advised change that demonstrates hostility to members of the Christian and Jewish faiths. As we told the University, While unfortunate, the 2011 riot is completely unrelated to the Universitys legal obligation to accommodate the religious observances of its students. They claimed that presenting Christian and Jewish students with the choice between attending class and following their faith was somehow trying to be inclusive, not exclusive. In fact, the Student Association has demanded that the University once again accommodate religious beliefs. Now, another SUNY university, this time Albany, has revoked its accommodation of religious holidays. Failing to accommodate the religious beliefs of a majority of the University students, when there are other alternatives to deal with unruly students, is unacceptable. Doing so flies in the face of religious accommodation, a constitutional principle that not only permits, but in some cases requires, the government to accommodate someones religious beliefs. The bottom line is the Constitution not only permits accommodation of religion, the law encourages, and in some cases, requires it. Our letter to the University urges that they return to their policy of accommodation.",1,3

In fact, rather than mention the dorm room in particular, just ask if a bedroom with fire sprinklers is required to have a window for emergency escape, natural light and ventilation. The local building inspector informed me today that because the room is equipped with a sprinkler system, the window is OK and meets code, even though it does not provide emergency escape. After you get the inspection report, you can consider whether to hold the seller liable for nondisclosure. The final issue is whether you hired a home inspector as part of your due diligence. Failure to have a professional home inspection is a common mistake among buyers making an as-is purchase. Buying a house as-is means that the seller will not make repairs.

2322,"C-sections should only be used if there are serious chances of a complication during normal childbirth, experts say, but are routinely used for low-risk births even though major surgery has many possible complications and risks of its own. Bending the cost curve of medicine The idea floated by advocates of the Affordable Care Act that the U.S. government could change the cost curve of medicine to achieve major savings wasnt well-explained by many Washington reporters. Kaiser Health News, however, had an encouraging report recently about Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach and how it has prompted doctors to stop recommending C-sections to women facing little risk of difficult childbirths. The study also found better hospitals only use episiotomies which make it easier for a baby to emerge from the womb 2 percent of the time versus 46 percent in less well-run hospitals. It may have the potential to bring U.S. health care costs more in line with those seen in other advanced countries so long as there are incentives to encourage physicians and hospital administrators to try to do whats most sensible, not whats easiest. Money and peer pressure pay off The wide variance in how hospitals deal with something as fundamental as childbirth is seen as one more byproduct of a complex health care system in which a third party (insurers or the government) often pays the cost of care provided to patients. Study: CA hospitals waste money by ignoring ‘big data’.The Moneyball phenomenon of using advanced statistical analysis to gain advantage in professional sports has picked up steam over the past dozen years, to the point where it has broadly depressed scoring in baseball, as fielders are positioned precisely based on the historical patterns of individual hitters. The study is encouraging because it suggests considerable savings are readily achieved if best practices are routinely followed, but frustrating because it shows how slow the health care establishment in California has been to embrace the approach. Initially, many attributed the high rates to the patients, saying they were older, had more complicated pregnancies or demanded scheduled C-sections. Encour",0,2
5376,"While the first quarters 7.8 percent vacancy rate indicates a strong retail market, Chynoweth said, The back story is the aggregate net operating income of all the shopping centers we dont have a way of tracking this probably looks pretty similar to what you see in office and industrial. The flurry of openings puts a good face on the retail market, which is still coping with restrained consumer spending and the overall anemic local economy, said both Ransom and Jim Chynoweth, managing director of commercial real-estate services firm CBRE. In the first quarter, the metros office market took a turn for the worse while the industrial market was stagnant, according to the latest data from the Albuquerque office of Colliers International. Albuquerques office market, after three years with a vacancy rate stuck between 18 percent and 19 percent, took a turn for the worse in the first quarter. As a third-tier or smaller metro, Albuquerque has traditionally lagged national economic trends so its no surprise that commercial real estate here remains largely mired in recession-like conditions. In the six years since the first quarter of 2007, when the vacancy rate was 6.3 percent, 1.6 million square feet of primarily warehouse space has gone empty in the industrial market. The thing thats interesting about retail is its not as dependent on job growth or supply and demand as office and even industrial, said Steve Maestas, managing partner of NAI Maestas amp; Ward Commercial Real Estate Services. The first quarters 21.5 percent office vacancy rate is approaching the all-time high of 22.4 percent set in 1989, according to historic data kept by CB Commercial, a predecessor company of CBRE, Chynoweth said. Were going to get some deals, but theres faster growth and more energy in surrounding markets, he said. A lift in job growth will get the (office) market right-sized pretty quickly, he said.

Its a sensitive subject in the Gaines family: Gaines Mifsuds father, William Gaines, who was publisher of Mad Magazine and the original Tales From the Crypt, was the unfortunate subject of a Senate investigation in 1954 that aimed to censor his no-holds-barred horror comics. An editorial by Gathy Gaines Mifsud, daughter of publisher William Gaines who was a target of a ghastly 1950s Senate investigation on censorship rails against Palins reported McCarthy-esque book-banning stunts while mayor of Wasilla, Alaska. The editorial takes aim at Palins reported preference for book-banning back when she was mayor of tiny Wasilla, Alaska. Tales From the Palin.The ghoulish comic Tales From the Crypt is taking a spooky look at the possibility of a Sarah Palin presidency. Tales From the Crypt is not endorsing any political candidates, nor are we attacking any candidates, Gaines Mifsud writes in the editorial. Wired: If the thought of Sarah Palin becoming vice president or even president of the United States scares the living daylights out of you, well youre not alone. The hysteria was stoked by the publication of Dr. Frederic Werthams ludicrous book, Seduction of the Innocent, released the same year. What usually seems to be behind banning books is an attempt to repress ideas that may offer alternative political views. This is not only un-American blatantly violating the very concept of free speech but it is assuming that people are unable to come to their own informed conclusions. Read more",1,1

And yet, in the current context, AI waits a long time between reports, and then mentions only a fraction of the abuses taking place and not necessarily the most egregious ones; it is just mentioning the discomfort of the rape victim. And finally, while during the second intifada the Palestinians have been smeared with crimes against humanity several times now, AI has not leveled a clear accusation of this crime against Israel although it would be rather apropos [7]. Circumscribing the crimes A careful reading of any AI statement referring to possible Israeli war crimes reveals another curious bias: the severity of the crimes referred to is restricted and only a fraction of Israeli actions are mentioned. Furthermore, in its latest press release AI used the phrase strongly condemned when referring to Israeli actions this reproach had been thus far usually reserved for Palestinian violence. Until now this is as far as AI is willing to go: Amnesty International calls on the international community: To bring to justice anyone suspected of war crimes or crimes against humanity who may be within their jurisdiction [15] Notice the courage exhibited here. Insult to injury The first sentence in AIs Oct. 13th press release appeared promising: [AI] condemns in the strongest terms the large-scale destruction by the Israeli army of Palestinian homes in a refugee camp in the southern Gaza Strip town of Rafah, which made homeless hundreds of people [4]. The report goes so far as to state: a UN committee monitoring human rights abuses of Palestinians [for the last 35 years] has concluded that the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank was the worst ever last year.

Warmer summers mean better French bubbly, but the future is uncertain..HAUTVILLERS, France - Climate change may be one of the greatest perils of our time, contributing to droughts, floods, deadly heat waves and super-charged hurricanes. Cheval said this year's early harvest also gave him a chance to employ high school students, who would have previously been back in class when the grapes are ripe. That's the earliest in almost two centuries.#160; Still, whatever disastrous effects climate change may have on low-lying tropical islands or on herders across the parched African desert, the Champagne region's elite are not protesting the earlier harvest - at least not yet. They say the climatic shift has made their lives easier and their Champagne better, allowing producers to harvest earlier than before. It also increases our chances to make great vintage wines. And he agrees: a hotter summer often means finer wine. Typically, the French abandon whatever might be going on at work to take vacation in August. Also, what helps the French bubbly isn't necessarily good for other French wines. ""#160; The warmer weather also recasts the uniquely French logistics of the harvest.

Northups own narrative is especially keen on this point his account of cotton-growing is, or should be, a staple assignment in history courses and screenwriter John Ridleys fidelity to the original text means the film produces a vivid dramatization of the way that planters sweated their labor: When a new hand, one unaccustomed to the business, is sent for the first time into the field, he is whipped up smartly, and made for that day to pick as fast as he can possibly. So Solomon Northup falls under the empire of his masters will, and so Steve McQueens film, with its insistent focus on the raw materiality, the violent discipline, and the capital rewards of slave labor, is bound to remind viewers of the work of Walter Johnson.

Republican members of Congress must enjoy pathetic approval ratings, because theyre apparently already raising hell about President Obamas call for a Congressional crackdown on offshore tax havens. #160; Former UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld, Stone reported, told Levins committee that hed been trained in illegal procedures and given a laptop with encryption software to hide its contents from US agents. The bank didnt deny that its US clients kept some $18 billion in 19,000 undeclared Swiss accountswhich earned UBS about $200 million per year, Birkenfeld told prosecutors. 3) Close a legal parlor trick that lets American firms shunt income between foreign subsidiaries in such a way that they end up owing no taxes. Obama figures his get-tough approach (see below) could bring the Treasury an extra $210 billion over ten years. Last time we touched base with Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat, he was blaming the tax cheats for Treasury losses of $100 billionper year. A bit of leadership on this stuff would be a refreshing change, since IRS enforcement was on ice throughout the Bush administration. 2) Strip away US companies tax deductions on offshore investments until they first pay their taxes on offshore profits. But the illegal practices have proliferated like mad since Ken Silverstein wrote us this Bahamian financial romp back in 2000.

What Dunkin' may have working in its favor is that an ice cream sandwich with a doughnut in place of the traditional cookie wafers actually seems like a good idea. As Taco Bell has rolled out many variations of its Doritos treat, there is no reason why Dunkin' can't add new flavors of doughnuts for its ice cream sandwich. Dunkin' probably waited too long to pull the trigger here, but the Donut Ice Cream Sandwich may still become a a big hit. That's still true for chains with very limited selections likeShake Shack, which caused a stir by adding a chicken sandwich, but most quick-serve establishments have such bloated menu boards that simply trotting out a barbecue sauce burger no longer moves the needle. This may not be an instant grand slam for the ice cream chain, but it has the potential to be a slow-build hit that can be kept going with limited-time offers and special selections. The Donut Ice Cream Sandwich may not shock people into sampling or garner much ""I can't believe that exists"" media coverage. It's an idea so obvious you have to wonder why it took this long The big challenge for Dunkin' is that the idea of an ice cream sandwich served on doughnuts no longer seems quite as outrageous as it would have just a few years ago.

There have been stories that the Kremlin finds the idea of turning Stalin's death into farce offensive, even of the film being banned in Russia. For sure, Putin is ultra sensitive about how his cult as the bare-chested strong man is promoted and, no doubt, he would not have liked how he has become, alongside Trump, a regular target of Saturday Night Live's mimicry. If you do make monsters a subject of ridicule while they are still alive it's wiser to do it from a distance, as Charlie Chaplin did with Hitler in The Great Dictator. But make no mistake, Stalin did direct a regime of terror that penetrated every level of life in the Soviet Union and from which nobody was safe. For years Beria remorselessly served Stalin's paranoia - purging thousands of imaginary traitors, perfecting ever more hideous forms of torture and humiliation, lasciviously pouncing on women for whom resistance would likely be fatal. The real hero is a collective: the great ineluctable tide of the risen proletariat, at first decimated as they gather in public places by the tsfar's machine gunners, and finally storming the Winter Palace in the onset of what John Reed indelibly stamped as Ten Days That Shook The World. When he viewed Eisenstein's final cut he ordered the removal of all scenes showing his most formidable ideological rival, Leon Trotsky, who, in the new Orwellian world of the Kremlin, had become a non-person.

It also contains the Regulatory Time-Out Act, which would prevent new economic regulations from being put in place for a year, a move Senate Dems view as just a backdoor way for Republicans to forestall Wall Street reform. While the GOP proposal contains some funds for infrastructure spending, rather than#160; accept a minor surtax#160;on millionaires#160;it pays for itself by cutting spending so drastically the White House has threatened a veto. Obama has actually put in place fewer regulations than Bush at this point in his term, and weak consumer demand rather than excessive regulation is holding back job growth, but why not ask for a pony even if you know youre not going to get one? This GOP alternative is less a jobs proposal than a deregulatory Christmas list. The bill would also restrict the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollution under the Clean Air Act, a change which the EPA estimates would lead to 20,000 premature deaths due to adverse health effects from pollution.

Another noted that this is the first year the Common Core State Standards are applicable in New Mexico, then asked, Why, when we dont even have enough books and are struggling to implement Common Core, is 50 percent of our evaluations based on these scores? Skandera held a public forum in Moriarty last week and said she plans to hold four more around the state in the near future to explain changes in New Mexicos education policy. The woman, apparently a teacher, said we would be penalized for that, a reference to the feedback teachers get from an automated, online evaluation program. Most of the questions put to Skandera on Tuesday were critical and included declaratory statements: The biggest mistake states make is rushing into an evaluation system. Many teachers, particularly in Albuquerque, but also around the state, dislike the approach the administration has taken. For example, when she tried to explain how teacher input was included in developing the new evaluation program, audience members challenged her assertions. Susana Martinez have been adamant in making changes in student testing and teacher evaluations to try to raise student growth and achievement. Skandera did her best to go over graduation requirements during the second half by trying to explain various testing procedures and rules to the crowd.

The labor union also quoted Valenzuela talking about the growing political importance of Latinos: Could you have imagined a vote like this before we started turning out the Latino vote? Students, hospitality workers and immigration reform supporters were among the estimated 100 people who gathered at the City Council to watch the vote, according to UNITE HERE, a labor union. Walsh quoted Valenzuela as saying to supporters after the vote: You can thank Mayor Stanton and the members of the City Council, but you should also look around. CASE student volunteer Faith Mendoza realized that the City Council was going to approve the resolution after she heard Stanton speak. Days before the Phoenix City Council vote, a#160; federal judge ruled on May 24 that Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and his deputies singled out Latinos#160;in their law enforcement actions, especially in the context of immigration.

The City Council approved the resolution by a vote of 6 to 1, community groups said. I didnt think it was going to happen, butwhen Mayor Stanton said voting for this immigration reform bill would be a no-brainer, I knew we had won, she said in a statement released by CASE.

6566,"Inwardly focused, self-absorbed congregations produce highly anxious leaders who live in fear of offending a constituent and with a nagging sense of building a church that Jesus would not attend. We may discover that the pivotal question for every healthy faith community remains what it has always been: is your focus internal or external? Such ministers are expected to provide whatever the congregation wants, even if it conflicts with his or her core convictions about the church. To shift our orientation from self-preservation and self-service to an outward orientation built upon a deep love of our city/community is to make the same transformative journey the disciples made as they walked alongside Jesus. Clergy and lay leaders spend untold amounts of energy seeking to provide just the right kind of food, environment, worship format, program, facility, etc., for those who attend our church. One pastor I know simply invited his congregation to start noticing and naming where I saw God at work today. To be outward-oriented is to recognize that God is at work both within and around the church and to seek out that activity and name it. Dave Ferguson, the lead pastor of Community Church in Chicago, suggests we need a new set of metrics to more adequately reflect our outward orientation. To reorient ourselves toward an outward focus is more than simply lip service to a generic missions program or tossing a few crumbs to the less fortunate around us. It may help to recognize that this is at the heart of the way Jesus taught us to live out our faith. He contends that until we get this right, our internally focused planning and programming obscures the most important task we have been given. It is to take seriously both the Great Commandment and the Great Commission, and to seek to integrate them into everything we do and say.",0,2

We know of nobody who claims that the original misery index currently stands at a good number, but it's not even close to being a record. Spokesman Fehrnstrom told us in an e-mail exchange: Eric Fehrnstrom, June 3: It [the ""Obama misery index""] is a rhetorical reference that encompasses real unemployment, foreclosures, bankruptcies, national debt and whatever other indicator that Governor Romney wants to use to illustrate the mess the country finds itself in. So to claim that economic misery is now worse than ever before, Romney invented a different index, which he described in his March 8 opinion piece: Romney, March 8: Today, we have a different set of ailments. So the original misery index currently stands at 12.26, after the announcement on June 3 that the unemployment rate for May went up to 9.1 percent. We have little doubt that Romney could combine all these statistical apples and oranges to come up with a ""record"" number, depending on how much weight he assigns to each factor he's mentioned. Debt is surely at a record, and rising every day, but how would Romney combine the $9.7 trillion that the U.S. government owes to the public with a 9.1 percent unemployment rate? That's the real record, and that's when Ronald Reagan used the ""misery index"" as a political club against Carter, ultimately winning the election that year. It is at a record high; indeed, it makes even the malaise of the Carter years look like a boom. And Romney was at it again June 2, when he officially launched his 2012 presidential campaign, saying that ""President Obama's own misery index"" has ""never been higher.""

SUBARU ASCENT Known for its small all-wheel-drive cars and SUVs, Subaru enters the big people-hauler market with the new Ascent. The new QX50 also boasts Infiniti's ProPilot driver assistance system that can automatically control braking and speed and keep the SUV within its lane. The German brand's flagship car, when equipped with a traffic jam pilot, has 24 radar, camera and laser sensors connected to a computer that can take charge of steering, acceleration and braking at up to 37 miles per hour on freeways with barriers dividing the directional traffic. The A8 gets a new 340-horsepower, 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine with a gas-electric hybrid system that helps it accelerate for better fuel economy and also powers all of its advanced features. The all-wheel-drive Ascent is powered by a new 2.4-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The fastback roof and minimalist styling remain, but there are two major changes: For the first time, the CLS will seat five and it's also a mild hybrid. It also has a suite of new safety technologies, including a system that keeps the SUV centered in its lane and an evasive maneuvering system that can automatically steer the vehicle around obstacles. Infiniti says the engine delivers 268 horsepower and 27 miles per gallon in combined city and highway driving, a 35 percent improvement in fuel efficiency over the outgoing QX50.

New customers helped to drive the growth in paid downloads, but Shutterstock also said that it was successful in expanding its sales related to enterprise customers, which generated much of the increase in revenue per download. Shutterstock's results fell short of what those watching the stock had hoped to see with respect to revenue, and even strong bottom-line performance wasn't enough to keep shareholders happy. Taking a closer look at Shutterstock's results, growth in some of the company's key operational metrics looked a bit less robust than investors had seen in previous quarters.

Verizon has been doing its own review to determine whether it should re-negotiate the sales price or cancel the deal entirely on the premise that the news of the security breaches will cause many people to become leery of using Yahoos email and other services in the future. Yahoos long-running slump culminated in the companys agreement last summer to sell its email service, websites and mobile applications to Verizon. ADVERTISEMENT But after striking the Verizon deal, Yahoo revealed that it had been hit by two separate hacking attacks that stole the email addresses, birth dates, answers to security questions, and other personal information from more than 1 billion user accounts.

After subtracting commissions paid to advertising partners, Yahoos revenue stood at $960 million, down from $1 billion in the previous year. If not for certain accounting items, Yahoo said it would have earned 25 cents per share.

The three separate attacks come amid heightened fear and anxiety among Indians living in the United States, with many pointing to the Trump administrations continued embrace of harsh anti-immigration policies as a primary factor fueling the violence. The shooting, which is currently being investigated as a potential hate crime, came less than two weeks after a man was arrested after he allegedly shot and killed one Indian man, Srinivas Kuchibholta, and injured his colleague, Alok Madasani, inside a Kansas bar. After initially rejecting any connection between his rhetoric and the Kansas shooting, President Donald Trump finally condemned racially motivated attacks in his first address to Congress Tuesday. In response to the recent attacks, some Indians are calling on the Indian government to issue an official warning against travel to the United States.

How Jon Scott could not know that Bill Clinton was a constant topic of both the media and the Trump campaign during the election is unimaginable. And the sad thing is that Fox News viewers are so delusional and hypnotized by their Tele-Master that they wont question this glaringly preposterous comment. Two months before the election Maggie Haberman of the New York Times tweeted an article by Buzzfeed that she said was a Pretty detailed read on Juanita Broaddricks long-ago allegations against Bill Clinton. Part of the discussion included an inquiry about Conways husband, George, who had curiously posted a number of tweets that were critical of Donald Trump. Conways complaint is particularly absurd considering that less than a week ago she brought up the political leanings of the spouse and children of former FBI Director James Comey in an attempt to discredit him. The network that relentlessly pumps out provably false stories despite having been debunked sometimes by their own reporters still manages to find ways to sink ever lower into states of purposeful amnesia. And leave it to Fox News to find a way to achieve that. He actually said that: Nobody was asking Hillary Clinton about the guy that shes married to.

Tom Coburn (R-OK) reiterated his concern about violence and unrest breaking out in the wake of President Obamas executive action to grant deportation relief for millions of undocumented immigrants, suggesting that Obamas move could worsen the ongoing tensions in Ferguson, Missouri. Presidents from both parties have used executive action at least 39 times in the last 60 years, including President Ronald Reagans actions to protect children of people who legalized under the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 and President George H.W. In 2007, President George W. Bush also took unilateral action on immigration after the Congress rejected his comprehensive immigration proposal. Although the Congress has not addressed our broken immigration system by passing comprehensive reform legislation, my administration will continue to take every possible step to build upon the progress already made, Bush said. Republicans have accused him of acting like an emperor of the United States and are discussing options to defund the agencies responsible for implementing the directive. This idea, the rule of law is really concerning a lot of people where I come from and whether its factual or perceptual, it really doesnt matter and the glue that holds our country together is really this common belief in the rule of law and when we see the things going on in Ferguson and the worries there about whether or not its equally applied, we shouldnt be doing anything right now to shake that worse.

But a jury was seated Monday, a day ahead of schedule, and the judge estimated no more than two dozen people were dismissed because of publicity about the case. Finding unbiased jurors can be difficult in any criminal trial, but jury selection in such high-profile cases such as the Holmes case, the Boston Marathon bombing trial and the trial of the man charged with killing the Navy SEAL depicted in the movie American Sniper are especially challenging. AMERICAN SNIPER KILLING The Oscar-nominated movie was released weeks before the start of jury selection, raising questions about whether it would be harder to find unbiased jurors. While opening statements are set for Wednesday in Texas in the killing of veteran Chris Kyle, hundreds of prospective jurors in the Colorado theater shooting begin returning to the courthouse for months of questioning about their views on the death penalty and mental illness. It took three weeks to empanel a jury in the case of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 1997.

It can add an another layer of qualifying to the homebuying process as the private mortgage insurance provider must deem the loan an acceptable risk, said Richard Greene of New Mexico Mortgage Co. ADVERTISEMENT Nationally, about 13 percent of all mortgages are protected by private mortgage insurance, according to a recent study from Norwest Mortgage. ADVERTISEMENT One way to bypass the insurance is by paying a one-time fee that gets amortized into the mortgage, Greene said. ADVERTISEMENT But at that point, the owner has to take the initiative by starting the process through the private mortgage insurance provider and paying for another property appraisal, he said. For potential homeowners who cannot come up with the 20 percent down payment most lenders require before issuing a mortgage, private mortgage insurance can be the lifeline needed to reach that magic figure. This may be an option particularly since private mortgage insurance providers have been more conservative in issuing insurance after the real estate boom went bust several years ago, Croft said. The provision that allowed those payments to be claimed as an income deduction on taxes, which had expired for the 2012 tax year, has been restored not only for 2013, but also retroactively for 2012, said Jim Begley, a loan officer with Albuquerques New Castle Mortgage Co. ADVERTISEMENT But private mortgage insurance can still be seen as a dual-edged sword. Homeowners generally pay $20 to $100 per month for the insurance, the Norwest study showed, as part of their mortgage payment, similar to paying property insurance and real estate taxes. In general, once a homebuyer has reached the 20 percent threshold in terms of equity which generally takes about eight years, according to the Norwest study the owner can seek its removal, Croft said. In addition, the homeowner must be current on payments and must have a record of making payments on time, Begley said.

Students should be sure they are able to attend full-time and have the resources to do so, he says. Adhering to Program Requirements To be assured that students will be able to take the courses they need to graduate in four years, schools often have strict guidelines for following a set curriculum. Were not surprised to see the four-year guarantee emerge, and expect it could become fairly standard in higher education, Craig says.#160;Its much easier for colleges and universities to adopt a guarantee like this than to make the more fundamental, structural changes that will really result in a better return on investment for students. In an effort to help students graduate on time without racking up serious debt, schools including the University of Minnesota, the University of Nebraska and Pace University in New York have introduced four year graduation plans where students finish in four years or their extra tuition will be free. In my experience, students must choose a major and stick to that path--I have seen a couple of programs that allow two years of general study without declaring a major, but then they must declare from a limited offering. Access to Courses Students who opt for a four year program will not likely deal with the frustration of being denied enrollment in a course needed for graduation.

At the time the photo was taken, Beijing's air pollution index was well into the hazardous zone at about 15 times of the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.

3543,"The more recent lawsuit contends that the sexual abuse occurred at the Texas ranch owned by the Karolyis, which has served as the training facility for the U.S. gymnastics team since 2001. The lawsuit, filed in California by a 24-year-old woman who was a member of the U.S. gymnastics team from 2004 to 2010 when she was ages 12 to 18, claims that Larry Nassar, the team doctor, penetrated her vagina with his fingers in the guise of adjusting her bones. The lawsuit also claims the Karolyis engaged in their own pattern of physical and emotional abuse, according to ESPNs John Barr. Nassar and the Karolyis are named as defendants in the lawsuit, along with USA Gymnastics, current President Steve Penny, past president Robert Colarossi, and Galina Marinova and Artur Akopyan, the gymnasts private coaches. In September, another former U.S. gymnast, a medalist at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, filed a lawsuit that made similar claims against Nassar. He also is under investigation in Michigan, where ESPN has found more than 30 complaints of criminal sexual misconduct lodged against him. According to the lawsuit, Bela and Marta Karolyi turned a blind-eye to Nassars sexual abuse of children at the ranch and instituted a regime of intimidation and fear by striking and scratching the gymnasts, depriving them of food and water, and humiliating them by telling them they were fat and making them strip to their underwear so they could be judged in front of their teammates. USA gymnastics fired Nassar as its team doctor in the summer of 2015 after receiving complaints about sexual misconduct during medical exams.

Jodi Routh testified that she did ask Chris Kyle to help her troubled son but that she didnt know he would take Routh to a shooting range. Prosecutors asked the mother if she regretted not telling Kyle of threats Routh had made to kill himself and his family. About 45 minutes later, authorities say Routh drove to his sisters Midlothian home in Kyles truck and told her he had killed Kyle and Littlefield.

We must continue our efforts to end the Israeli Occupation, even if this is means, ultimately, the creation of a genuine Palestine/Israel or a wider regional confederation, rather than apartheid-cum-two-state solution or warehousing. From every point of view, historically, culturally, politically and economically, the Palestinians have been defined as surplus humanity; nothing remains to do with them except warehousing, which the concerned international community appears willing to allow Israel to do. The facts of the matter that there never was a generous offer and that even if Barak had offered 95% of the Occupied Territories (as Olmert has recently offered 93%), a Palestinian state would constitute little more than a truncated and non-viable South African bantustan on less than 20% of historic Palestine disappear in the spin. Despite the almost unlimited and unchecked power Israel has over every element of Palestinian life, including the active support of the US, Europe and much of the international community, including some Arab and Muslim regimes, it has failed to nail down either apartheid or warehousing. Instead of presenting the international community with thorny issues that must be resolved violations of human rights, international law and repeated UN resolutions, let alone the implications of the conflict itself on international politics and economy it is instead seen as providing a valued service: developing a model by which surplus populations everywhere can be controlled, managed and contained.

Continue Reading Below Look under the hood of Citis earnings and youll see the bank dramatically goosed its profits higher by booking outsized paper gains from an accounting trick thats legitimate under current rules, and by releasing loan loss reserves into earnings. The accounting moves Citi deployed include an $8.2 billion release of loan-loss reserves into 2011 earnings, as well as booking in profits $1.8 billion in paper gains on its debt. Called a debt valuation adjustment or credit valuation adjustment, the move lets banks book in their profits paper gains that they get to come up with all on their own. For one, the banks under the accounting rules get to come up with their own measure of the gains they can take here, based on their assessment of the trading values of their debt. The theory is the bank would realize a profit if it bought back its own debt at that lower value. However, when a banks bond drops in value because no one wants them, an odd accounting rule enacted in 2007 says a bank can book a paper profit based on that drop in value, whats called below par value. So when the housing crash happened, bank asset values plunged, and bank profits were going to get socked. Other major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley have used this accounting adjustment to get a similar earnings boost. Citi attributed its revenue decline to a $6.4 billion drop in revenue at its bad bank, Citi Holdings, which it has been trying to unwind. Citigroup got $45 billion TARP bailout money, which it has since repaid, as well as an initial government backstop to its troubled balance sheet of about $306 billion.

For politicians, as the White House is now demonstrating, many leaks are excellent while others are very bad and the crucial question is usually whether the revealed facts are flattering or embarrassing. Is it always bad to leak sensitive classified information to a reporter for the Washington Post? As Woodward researched his 2002 bestseller, top officials told him about covert operations, secret sources and methods, and relationships with foreign intelligence services all with the blessing of President Bush. In fact, selective leaks that advance the objectives of the White House and the Pentagon by misinforming the public are not really leaks at all. Distinguishing good leaks from bad is especially relevant today, when officials who disclose the wrong information to the wrong people at the wrong time may risk federal prosecution. The CIA is zealously pursuing staffers who may have disclosed nasty secrets to the press about the secret prisons it has been operating abroad. A desultory investigation by the FBI ended without the issuance of any subpoenas, and the bureau referred its findings to the Senate Ethics Committee, which dropped the matter without taking any action against the Alabama Republican. The agency has dismissed a longtime employee because of allegedly unauthorized discussions with Washington reporters, including Dana Priest of the Washington Post, who won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking the secret-prison story.

The survey noted that 65% of student debtors intend to pay off their student loans first and then save more for retirement. A retirement paved with good intentions The Merrill Edge report suggests that most millennials think more responsibly than this with respect to retirement, but just like all generations, they are having some difficulty acting on it. One has to assume the numbers are even higher for millennials with too few investable assets to be included in the survey. People with advanced degrees or with student loans outside the federal system are already dealing with significantly higher interest rates. Current undergraduate student loan rates are not terribly high at 4.66%, but thanks to recent legislation, the rate is now adjusted annually based on the financial markets, and these rates are highly likely to increase in the future. In that study, 24% of millennials expect that their student loan balances will eventually be forgiven.",1,3

Nathan Peterman will get the start at quarterback Sunday against the Chargers, a move that was greeted with a bit of wariness by a Buffalo team that is inside the top six for an AFC playoff berth. Shaq Lawson had been solid against the run until the last two games, and he has brought nothing as a pass-rushing end. It certainly seems like a tenuous position given how they played in losing 34-21 to the Jets and 47-10 to the Saints, but its clear McDermott believes Peterman can get the offense back on track in a system that may be more suited to his skills than Taylor. WR Kelvin Benjamin will make his second start with the Bills, one week after a debut that included only three catches for 42 yards. I spoke with Brandon (Beane, the general manager) like I do about every decision, but really, its about becoming a better team and the quarterback position is not different. Hughes has only three sacks thus far, a disappointment given that hes back in his preferred 4-3 defense. Defensive end Jerry Hughes has been sidelined with a shin injury suffered in the Saints game, but while he didnt practice Wednesday, he seemed fine in the locker room and will most likely start in Los Angeles. Several veterans seemed a bit tepid, though they believe head coach Sean McDermott is doing what he thinks is best and they have bought into his process. Of course, hes the only guy who can get to the quarterback, so he draws constant double-teaming, and the rest of the front line is being single-blocked, and losing. That sends three-year starter Tyrod Taylor to the bench at a critical time in the season, and speaks to the power McDermott wields in his rookie season as an NFL head coach. Taylor admitted to being shocked by the move, but the Bills passing",0,4

Affleck's carefully worded statement on Tuesday was immediately slammed by actress Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein's alleged victims, and then followed by an accusation that Affleck himself was guilty of ""groping"" actress Hilarie Burton back in 2003.

First, Norm begged Naders running mate Peter Camejo to throw in the towel during a debate in early 2004, well before Nader or the Greens had even announced candidates.

11549,"But this years work camp may make the continuing demolition of homes in Anata a little harder, Halper reckons its one thing to destroy a home supposedly built illegally by a Palestinian, but another to destroy one built with money provided by the Spanish government. He noted that Israels policy of refusing building permits to many of the 250,000 Palestinians in East Jerusalem has resulted in the classification of 20,000 city homes as illegal since the occupation began in 1967. The issue of house demolitions is back in the spotlight now after two separate incidents in July in which Palestinians, both of whom were residents of Jerusalem, rampaged through the city in bulldozers, killing three Israelis and injuring many more. Although the two Palestinians were shot dead at the scene, Israeli officials, including Ehud Barak, the defence minister, are calling for their homes to be destroyed, making their families homeless, to deter others from following in their path. Today the house is overlooked by an Israeli police station across the valley, part of the advance growth of a large Jewish settlement, Maale Adumum, that Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups believe is cutting the West Bank in two. This is the first time a government has supported the rebuilding of an illegal Palestinian home demolished by the Israeli authorities, Halper says. Most demolitions are of multi-storey buildings that are home to several families, meaning that well in excess of 100,000 Palestinians may have been made homeless by Israeli administrative policies, he said. Since its founding a decade ago, the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions has rebuilt 150 Palestinian homes as part of its campaign to bring the issue of demolitions to the attention of Israeli Jews and the international community. Illegal building is simply a pretext for destroying Palestinian families homes and lives, says Jeff Halper, head of the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions (ICAHD).

Second, anyone who is familiar with the Israeli border police knows that if Nawi had actually attacked the officers it is quite unlikely that he would have been able to walk out of the shack. Any form of civil disobedience or direct action, like lying in front of a bulldozer that is building the annexation barrier or demolishing a house, picking olives in a grove or walking Palestinian children to school in an area that has been classified a closed military zone, is now subject to harsh punishment. And, in some cases, even these kinds of protests are prohibited, as in Sheikh Jarrah where activists are repeatedly arrested simply for demonstrating against the seizure of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem. Nawi and other Taayush activists have, over the years, aided the expelled Palestinians to return to the last swathe of land they can still call their own. We joined a group of Jews and Palestinians from Taayush in the South Hebron desert to break bread together and bid farewell to Ezra Nawi, who the following day began serving a jail sentence for resisting Israels occupation. We chose this spot because almost a decade ago the Palestinian cave dwellers who lived there were expelled from their ancestral land by Jewish settlers from Susya; these settlers were supported by the Israeli government, military and courts. The Israeli court has basically decreed that the only legitimate way to oppose the occupation is by standing on the side of the road with some kind of placard.

66,"Blinded by anti-government ideology, we fail to notice that the rest of the world invests much more in their young people, especially the very young: On average across OECD countries, 84 percent of pupils in early childhood education attend programmes in public schools or government-dependent private institutions, while in the U.S., 55 percent of early childhood pupils attend programmes in public schools, and 45 percent attend independent private programmes. But overall, dont we still lead the world in big government support for higher education? Unfortunately, we place more of the burden on students and their families than just about any other developed nation: In the U.S., 38 percent of higher education expenditures come from public sources, and 62 percent are from private sources. (See Crazy Country: 6 Reasons America Spends More on Prisons Than On Higher Education). The rich are quite happy for the rest of us to swallow the myth of American exceptionalism, even when reality shows how exceptionally bad we are at providing decent education for all of our people. But, as the politicians tell us, we are going to win the global competition for knowledge-based industries and jobs, precisely because we have the best universities and the most college graduates. The odds that a young person in the U.S. will be in higher education if his or her parents do not have an upper secondary education are just 29 percent -- one of the lowest levels among OECD countries. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) report, which compares the educational systems of over 30 developed nations, provides data that, when it comes to education, proves were so far from being number one, that the entire idea of American exceptionalism should be called into question.

4608,"Whatever the cause, a healthy forest depends on these episodic events and so-called forest restoration only impoverishes forest ecosystems by removing the dead trees and reducing the likelihood of new mortality. Another study found fuel treatments cannot realistically be expected to eliminate large area burned in severe fire weather years. Dead trees that fall into streams are both structural components that reduce bank erosion but also provide the bulk of habitat for aquatic life. Yet another study that reviewed 1,500 fires found that blazes that occurred in protected areas like wilderness and parks burned at lower severity than fires in areas with active management meaning logging. The best use of our national forests is protecting carbon storage, creating wildlife habitat (which is often the result of wildfires) and maintaining ecological and evolutionary processes. Even forest fires leave behind more carbon since what typically burns in a fire is the fine fuels, not the tree boles and roots where the bulk of carbon is located. Colville forest Supervisor Rodney Smoldon was quoted as suggesting that removal of trees would expand forest restoration work necessary to reduce the risk of wildfire in northeast Washington. The main factors that create episodic inputs of dead trees are large, high-severity wildfires, insect outbreaks, and sometimes drought and other factors. And since all large fires occur under extreme fire weather, this suggests that so-called fuel reduction projects are a waste of money. Beyond the habitat necessary for wildlife, dead trees are important for carbon storage. Beyond the fact that thinning projects cannot realistically halt blazes that occur under extreme fire weather conditions, logging is not restoration. High severity fires increase the abundance and diversity of native birds which are the main pollinators of our plants both domestic and wild.",1,1

13994,"The public recognizes this fact and will demand good economic policy even as the punditry continue to push policies that would throw the economy into another depression. Depression Nostalgia?.The Washington policy debates of the last week would almost make a casual observer believe that the nations political leadership is in fact nostalgic for the good old days of the Great Depression when the country suffered double-digit unemployment for a decade. On the other hand, if he has managed to bring the unemployment rate down to a reasonable level, no one other than a few Washington pundits will be bothered by the deficit that might have been necessary to achieve this result. If the unemployment rate is 12 percent when President Obamas first term ends, he can forget about getting re-elected, even if the budget is balanced. Other data also showed house prices in a free fall, most notable the Commerce Departments series on new home sales, which showed a drop of 10 percent in the median price between December and January. With vacant housing units at record levels, and many potential homebuyers no longer having the equity in their current homes for a down payment, it is difficult to see how this free fall stops any time soon. In particular, many commentators questioned whether he would reach his deficit target for 2012 because the economy might be weaker than his budget assumes. The two big news items last week were a batch of absolutely horrible economic reports and the release of President Obamas budget. Lets suppose that the pundits are correct and the economy sinks farther and later grows more slowly than the Obama administration assumed in planning its budget. The unemployment rate is likely to hit 8.0 percent for the month and it could well be over 9.0 percent by the summer. It is not clear that President Obama can accomplish the full agenda laid out in his budget, but there is no doubt that he hopes to accomplish a great deal in his term in office. Remarkably, much of the discussion of the budget did not focus on President Obamas agenda, but rather his deficit targets.",1,1

The wizards of Wall Street are raring to get back to business as usual and if we let them, well have only ourselves to blame when the next meltdown comes. Compensation is the marquee issue the unimaginable amounts of money Wall Streets alleged best and brightest paid themselves for taking stupid risks with our money. Wall Streets actual role is more like that of a giant casino where the gamblers are rewarded for taking outrageous, unconscionable risks with other peoples money. I dont see how this materially differs from theft, and I heard nothing from Obama about trying to claw any of this money back. Wall Street Is Still Playing the Odds.Its been a year since the financial system collapsed like a botched souffl, and the sense of acute crisis has eased. At this point, the temptation is to ask what difference another trillion-dollar problem would make. Wall Streets theoretical role is to allocate capital most efficiently to the companies that can make the best use of it. And many economists believe theres another blow coming.",1,1

Practices that were once seen as a repugnant surrender to government indifference, like food banks, are now virtually celebrated as a high point of citizen engagement and promoted as such by our public broadcaster once a year. Steiger told the Peak that for the past few months there had been many instances of actual shortages, bad enough that she felt the food shortages border on elder abuse. And other practices, like hospitals and seniors care homes that once had their own kitchens and cooking staff, are seemingly a thing of the past, a luxury that we have no hope of ever getting back. It was a grim account of what the elderly put up with in two seniors residences operating under the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCHA) with food services also provided by Sodexo. I should point out that in every other aspect the care was exemplary but my partner diligently brought me real food at mealtimes. This kind of secrecy is hardly new but its voluntary enforcement in an area as critical as health is particularly offensive a body appointed to ensure health outcomes of citizens chooses loyalty to a foreign corporation over caring for patients. It is virtually impossible to find out what is in the food they prepare, where it comes from or to compare it and its actual cost to real food that is a prepared on site in other facilities. According to Kimmetts investigative piece: Both parties cited contractual confidentiality for what they couldnt share about whats being provided to the sick, injured and elderly in Vancouvers hospitals. But the rethermalized slop that passes for food prepared by giant multinationals like the French multinational Sedexo ($6 billion in yearly revenue, 10,000 Canadian employees) should be against the law.

But you knew that the Justice Department was never going to recover more than a small fraction of the damages that JPMorgan and others caused, because if they were to collect the damages, every large bank in America would be bankrupt. And for an entity like JPMorgan--actually, I'm not sure that it would result in a 33#160;percent reduction, because JPMorgan pays so little in the way of taxes, but it certainly would end up in some deduction that would further reduce the supposed size of this fine. That still, of course, is a large number, but compared to how much wealth was extracted by the senior officers and directors, it's actually not that big a deal, and compared to the losses they caused to the world through these frauds that drove the financial crisis, it's actually a pittance.

So what the Justice Department is agreeing is that JPMorgan can count all these loan workouts that it would have done anyway to minimize its losses as if they were part of a settlement. Black also says the bank will be able to reduce the fine by approximately $7 billion through payment reductions and tax deduction. But as it's being portrayed in the press, they are going to give up the ability to prosecute for literally tens of thousands of frauds committed by JPMorgan's folks, and they're going to give up the ability to prosecute JPMorgan as well as the individuals.

Continue Reading Below Veitch's attorney, Jeff Gutchess of the Bilzin Sumberg firm, said in an interview that Virgin wholeheartedly embraced Veitch's ideas in early 2011 and then abruptly did an about-face by forcing a costly renegotiation of their partnership terms. It was then, according to his lawsuit, that Virgin changed terms of their deal in such a way that Veitch would become essentially an employee whose share of the profits depended upon Virgin. Ex-cruise line CEO sues Virgin, Richard Branson for $300M over plans for new cruise enterprise.The former chief executive officer of Norwegian Cruise Line is suing British billionaire Richard Branson and his Virgin Group conglomerate, claiming that Virgin essentially stole his ideas and business plans to enter the lucrative luxury cruise industry by building a pair of state-of-the-art ships capable of carrying 4,200 passengers each. In a statement at the time, Branson promised Virgin Cruises would be different from the current roster of cruise companies. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Miami federal court on behalf of Colin Veitch and his VSM Development company, seeks more than $300 million in damages and asks a judge to stop London-based Virgin from going forward with its recently announced cruise line. Under this deal, Veitch would get nothing if the ships were not profitable but stood to make $315 million if his projections were met.

Citing information provided by Jones, the TIME article said CCA kept the unredacted quality assurance reports for in-house use only so as to limit bad publicity, litigation or fines that could derail CCAs multimillion dollar contracts with federal, state or local agencies. He contributed a chapter to PLNs third anthology, Prison Profiteers: Who Makes Money from Mass Imprisonment, and has spoken on justice-related topics at Yale University, an annual meeting of the National Lawyers Guild, and Critical Resistance; at legislative committee hearings in two states; and before the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security. CCA officials responded by quickly contacting their government contract partners and telling them Jones allegations were completely false although the company acknowledged that appropriate information gathered in the audits is separately provided to our legal department, and Puryear admitted that CCA did not make our customers aware of these documents, referring to the detailed quality assurance reports kept for in-house use only. Prior to Puryears Feb. 12, 2008 hearing before the Judiciary Committee, Friedmann sent statements and proposed questions to the Committee members that addressed Puryears conflicts of interest, lack of experience, bias against prisoner litigation, concealment of information from the public, and role in the Estelle Richardson case.

Historians have dismissed the veracity of such accounts of events in Ireland prior to the fifth century, but these legends may not be entirely far-fetched, given research carried out by geneticists in Trinity College Dublin and Queens University Belfast. Use of Cinel, an alternative Irish word for clan, meaning family, died out centuries ago but can be found in the records of monks from the time of Saint Patrick in the fifth century.

In November, New Mexico voters will be asked to decide if we want the state to invest our permanent fund in foreign corporations.

In the alternative, Romney suggested that his tax rate should be considered almost 40 percent because he gave a substantial amount of money to charity, mostly to the Mormon church. Watch it: Romney glosses over the fact that he is not a corporation and doesnt pay corporate taxes. When Univisions Jorge Ramos asked Romney if his 13 percent tax rate is fair, Romney suggested adding the maximum corporate tax rate (35 percent) to his personal taxes to calculate his real rate: RAMOS: You just released your tax returns. ROMNEY: Well, actually, I released two years of taxes and I think the average is almost 15 percent. In 2010 you only paid 13 percent of taxes while most Americans paid much more than that. Additionally, most corporations pay far lower than a 35 percent rate. One of the reasons why we have a lower tax rate on capital gains is because capital gains are also being taxed at the corporate level. So, all total, the tax rate is really closer to 45 or 50 percent. So as businesses earn profits, thats taxed at 35 percent, then as they distribute those profits as dividends, thats taxed at 15 percent more.

Trump has begun to put in place the apparatus that will attempt to implement his reactionary vision a racist Attorney General with a history of attacks against African Americans and opposition to equal rights to lead the Department of Justice and its Civil Rights Division; a billionaire opponent of public schools to run the Department of Education; a climate change denier to lead the Environmental Protection Agency; a foe of raising the minimum wage to head the Department of Labor. Within the past few years we have seen massive upsurges of people demanding change, from the Occupy movement to Black Lives Matter to the powerful support of the Bernie Sanders candidacy. The rise of neoliberalism meant tax breaks for the rich, free trade, and free market capitalism, endless wars to protect narrow interests, reduction in support for education, housing, and public transportation, the virtual destruction of unionized working conditions in the private sector, opposition to affirmative action and equal opportunity through promotion of the myth of a colorblind society, and the use of police terror to compel submission to the neoliberal agenda.

In addition to making it less onerous to qualify for public financing in the mayors race, the report suggested more accountability for the system and proposed increasing the amount of public financing in the mayors race to make publicly financed candidates more competitive with privately financed candidates. In the 2013 election, incumbent Mayor Richard Berry, who had been elected using public financing just four years earlier, instead chose to raise $850,000 in private contributions many of which came from the most powerful and well connected in Albuquerque. If any of the three 2009 mayoral candidates would have raised private money, their opponents would have been given matching funding to level the playing field. However, in 2011 the same Supreme Court behind the 2010 Citizens United decision struck down a similar Arizona matching-funds provision, which essentially gutted the Albuquerque system, at least for mayoral candidates. The battle could have looked a lot more like the 2009 mayoral race when all three mayoral candidates spent their time talking to voters, rather than soliciting contributions from the most powerful interests in the city. Unfortunately, opposition to the measure from some mayoral candidates killed the proposal that would have addressed one of the key flaws in the current system. ADVERTISEMENT After the dust settles in the 2017 mayors race, Albuquerque voters will have a chance to decide whether to repair the current system if it has not been so damaged by some of the current slate of privately funded mayoral candidates and their operatives. Media reports have not yet, but hopefully will, investigate the role privately funded mayoral campaigns played in quashing the proposed fix to the system. Part of the reason was that the original public financing system provided for matching funds to publicly funded candidates to keep pace with privately funded candidates. However, mayoral candidates and their political operatives under",0,0

""The last time the number of immigrants came to the United States matched 2014-2015 was in 2000-2001, when as many as 3.3 million immigrants arrived."" These multiple entries are what is reported in the Annual Yearbook of Immigration Statistics and other publication put out by DHS not new visas or those entering for the first time. Because DHS reports multiple entries of the same person, it cannot be used to determine if the number of non-immigrants coming and staying in the United States is increasing or decreasing. Center for Immigration Studies The Center writes that long-term temporary non-immigrant visas are a major problem, noting: Much more important in terms of numbers, however, is the increase in long-term temporary non-immigrant visas in the last two years that allow for stays in the United States for a long enough period to show up as new arrivals in Census Bureau data.21 Excluding short-term visas such as tourists and business travelers, the number of long-term visas issued at overseas posts increased by 554,000 in the 2014-2015 period compared to 2012-2013.22 The 2012-2013 period was also an increase over the previous two years. The Center posited that of the 3.1 million immigrants in 2014-2015, 1.1 million were new illegal immigrants; legal immigrants increased from 1.6 million in 2012-2013 to two million in 2014-2015. Uh-Oh: MASSIVE Surge In Illegal Immigration In 2014-2015.According to the Center for Immigration Studies, immigration skyrocketed in 2014-2015, as 3.1 million legal and illegal immigrants emigrated to the United States, 39% more than in 2012-2013, when 2.3 million immigrants arrived. In 2010 and 2011, 2.1 million new immigrants arrived. The Center claimed several factors played a part in stimulating immigration: reduced enforcement, the economy improving, and the expansive nature of our legal immigration system.

The big picture is that Ionis' present market cap of approximately $3.11 billion comes across asdirt cheap for a company with nearly 30 clinical trials underway -- so long as these safety hiccups really are confined to just to IONIS-TTRRx andvolanesorsen. Having said that, there's a good chance that Biogen is indeed mulling over a tender offer for Ionis for the reasons mentioned above -- along with the biotech's well-known desire to diversify its clinical and product portfolios. According to the company, severe drop-offs in platelet levels were only detected in trials assessing IONIS-TTRRx andvolanesorsen, but not across its broad pipeline of second-generation antisense product candidates, which sports a total of 15 drugs currently in the clinic. The net result is that Ionis has shed nearly 60% of its value since the start of 2016 due to concerns that its antisense drug platform may be riddled with safety problems. But even if a deal doesn't go through, Biogen and Ionis would both benefit tremendously from an approval fornusinersen based on its sizable commercial opportunity -- making both of these biotech stocks worth a deeper dive right now.

The teen who did it seems to be a 'problematic foster child' who was arrested two weeks ago already near where the attack took place. As said yesterday, police had arrested an 18-year old in the port city of Dover, suspected of plotting and carrying out the attack on the metro of Parsons Green which wounded over 30 people.

7940,"4 Stash Some Cash for Emergencies and Living Expenses Nothing will make you sleep better at night than the financial freedom of having some cash tucked away for emergencies like having to get the car repaired, needing some unexpected dental work or losing a job. The only thing you have to fear in an economic crisis is not having some cash reserves in a savings plan you can immediately get your hands on. When you have a cash cushion you can get your hands on immediately, then magically, you stop worrying about money, your attention goes back on living life and enjoying it, and making money suddenly gets easier. 3 Make the Money BEFORE Spending It If there is some large purchase you need to make or want to make in the future, start putting small amounts in a savings account towards that purchase and keep that up until you have the cash to pay for it. Out of every bit of income that comes in the door, immediately carve off 10% and put it in a savings account that you have designated for your cash cushion. Those future earnings will be needed to pay your regular household expenses, so you end up in economic slavery known as the credit trap. If you have 10 years before your child enters college, then find out what the tuition will be and figure out how much you have to put away every week to have the cash the year they graduate from high school. As the weeks roll by youll find you sleep better at night and walk through life with a lot more confidence knowing you have achieved financial freedom and have protected yourself from the economic crisis looming on the horizon. 2 Pay CASH Every time you purchase something using credit cards that you cannot pay off as soon as the statement arrives, you are committing your future earnings to the credit company. The people who had cash stashed away were able to buy houses, property and whole companies for pennies on the dollar. Here is what you can do to make sure that the economics of your household are strong and stable, even though the economy of the country may be on the slippery slide to disaster.

Arizona and Alaska, the other two states required to get the feds permission before changing their election laws, ranked much lower in anti-black bias. Elmendorf and Spencers study came too late: On Tuesday, the Supreme Court struck down the portion of the VRA that governs which states are and are not required to seek the feds permission to change their election rules. In May, Christopher Elmendorf and Douglas Spencerlaw professors at the University of California-Davis and the University of Connecticut, respectivelyreleased a paper arguing that the list of states required to obtain federal approval under the VRA remarkably mirrors the geography of anti-black prejudice in the United States. Without making such a claim, though, it was harder for the government to defend the VRAs requirement that some statesbut not othersseek federal approval (which lawyers call preclearance) before changing their voting laws. Not surprisingly, the Obama administration was not willing to assert that citizens in Southern states were statistically more likely to hold racist beliefs. But as Elmendorf and Spencer note, these states are presumably required to seek that permission because of other biasanti-Latino in Arizona and anti-Native American in Alaskawhich their study did not measure. (Besides the eight states mentioned above, the VRA requires some counties and municipalities in seven other states to seek federal permission to change election rules.)

I will be the first person in line to support a state's right to adopt its own unique higher standards, as long as they are rigorously assessed and transparently reported.

Common Core State Standards are the very least we must do to accelerate student learning. Right now in South Korea, parents labor at second jobs to save for ""hagwagons"" - rigorous tutoring centers where students spend hours studying after their normal school day is over - to ensure their child has the best chance possible to be accepted to a top university. In Poland, student achievement skyrocketed in the short period between 2000 and 2006 because the nation's new leaders radically dismantled and reinvented its school system as opposed to tinkering around the edges of reform. Common Core standards don't change data privacy policies, don't harm parental choice and don't dictate what books kids are assigned to read or how teachers teach. If unions released their grip on political levers, and parental choice was absolute, many public school reforms would be unnecessary because the desired results would be achieved through market forces.

Vachon said Soros, in making political contributions in the two races in metro Phoenix, isnt trying to tell people in Arizona how to vote. ADVERTISEMENT Michael Vachon, a Soros adviser who serves as his spokesman, said Soros contributed to candidates in these local law enforcement races because of his longtime interest in ending mass incarceration, combatting racial disparities within the criminal justice system and abolishing the death penalty. Vachon said Soros is leveling the playing field against the $12 million raised by Arpaio, whose contributions have come from people mostly living elsewhere. Campaign finance reports from earlier in the election cycle showed that Soros had spent nearly $4 million on various local law enforcement races. The longtime bankroller of liberal causes had focused his political giving in the past on mostly federal races, but has broadened his contributions over the last year by backing Democrats in local district attorney races in Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Mississippi, Texas, Missouri, Florida, Colorado, Georgia and Arizona. Chad Willems, Arpaios campaign manager, said Soros was trying to buy the sheriffs race in Phoenix. Vachon said Soros opposes Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaios immigration enforcement efforts and harsh jail policies, including his practice of incarcerating inmates in surplus military tents. One of the anti-Montgomery ads mentioned that mistakes by the prosecutors office let a former sheriff deputy accused of corruption go free. A political group funded largely by Soros has run TV ads that criticized Arpaio for botching hundreds of sex-crime cases after they were reported to the sheriffs office.

Kennan then suggests that, although the Russians were still fundamentally opposed to peaceful coexistence with the West and inclined to achieve the extension of the Soviet socialist system around the world, they were particularly sensitive to the logic of military force and will respond or retreat in the face of skillful and determined resistance to their wishes for expansion. His postwar writings about the supposed Soviet threat nurtured the U. S. policy of containment that led to the devastating arms race that still threatens the world with utter destruction. Thus, Kennan goes on to advocate a policy of counter-pressure where the Soviets threatened or it could be predicted that such counter-pressure could lead to the Soviets being willing to cooperate with the US or, eventually, be seen to lead to an internal collapse of the Soviet government. In Latin America, the current U.

Although the Federal Police hold a 24-hour standing blockade in full riot gear on all the streets surrounding the Zocalo, people still insist Oaxaca City cannot be occupied by anyone but the people themselves. In The APPOs Gaze Though the exit of governor Ulises Ruiz seems to be APPOs primary concern, and indeed APPO was formed as a reaction to the violent attempted eviction of the teachers union sit-in in June by the governor, there exists a deeper political desire within the APPO. In an attempt to satisfy negotiations with the APPO to take down the remaining barricades, the government has released a few dozen political prisoners in small groups each day, but as some prisoners are released more people become detained or become disappeared. A caller on the same PRIista radio called on people to kill any foreigner they see with a camera, and it is believed that the government used the death of a foreigner as a a justification for the need of order in Oaxaca and to carry out more arbitrary detentions of protesters. Before the federal forces entered Oaxaca there were close to three thousand barricades of varying sizes around the city, but today the Cinco Senores Barricade is ground zero for the flickering visibility of APPO in the city.

Mike Honda, a 73-year-old, seven-term progressive backed by organized labor, against fellow Democrat Ro Khanna, a young patent attorney who has never held elected office but is bankrolled by the Valleys tech elite. And like many startups, Khanna seems to have attracted tech donors based more on his educational pedigree and the force of his ideas than his actual accomplishments. He supports increasing overall taxes on the rich, supports paid maternity leave and child#160;care tax credits, and creating an Internet Bill of Rights that would outlaw mass surveillance and allow people to know how tech companies use their data.

I think Silicon Valley can help make that case, that there are areas of government spending on basic science and research that help make America an economic superpower. But there are clearly more of them in the Valley than there used to be, which is one reason Khanna may have a crack at going to Washington. I dont think the tech community and those who have done well are sufficiently empathetic to that.

A source told the Herald that Tannehill is expected to miss significant time, but he could play again this season if he avoids surgery. Right now, Matt is our quarterback and well see where we go from there, because Ive got to figure out whats going on with Ryan and then well make decisions after that, Gase said.

UNM decided to pay the difference for students with financial need and those who also received merit scholarships. The University of New Mexico is covering the difference between lottery scholarship payments and tuition for more than half of its students who received the scholarship for the spring semester, which just got underway. Last year, the Legislature defined maximum lottery award amounts as 100 percent of the tuition average for various categories of institutions, or, if tuition is lower than the average, the full tuition level of that particular institution. Thats when UNM decided to step in and cover the scholarship reduction for the majority of students. In its letter to lottery students with merit awards, the university said: We hope you are enjoying your winter break!

The Canadian Extradition Act allows for the requesting country, in this case France, to submit nothing more than a summary of its evidence before sending Canadian citizens to face trial abroad. ~~~ BOTTING: Because Canada's a common-law country, we always send back people to face the music, back in the country they came from or where the offense is alleged to have been committed, whereas that's not necessarily reciprocated. ~~~ BEHRENS: And just to give you a sense of the extradition cases that come before the Canadian justice minister, in 1999, Queen's Bench Justice Steel wrote, quote, evidence at an extradition hearing should be accepted even if the judge feels it is manifestly unreliable, incomplete, false, misleading, contradictory of other evidence, or the judges feel the witness may have perjured themselves.

5026,"Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future A book by Martin Ford Theres good reason to believe that robots will replace more and more workers, especially those who perform routine tasks, in the coming years. Yes, American jobs are disappearing, but Ford never makes a convincing case that automation rather than the neoliberal policies we have pursued for decades is the main culprit. Although that field is shedding jobs for reasons less directly related to robots, I suspect we will demand conscious journalism (as well as news) for some time to come. By putting robots at the center of his health care discussion, for example, he seems to overlook the real reasons Americans pay so much (and show worse health outcomes) compared with residents of other advanced countries. Like many casual observers, Ford thinks higher education is primarily about information, which has never been cheaper or more abundant. Yet even as Fords argument fragments, his discussion moves toward intriguing policy questions and solutions, the most important of which is a guaranteed income. To illustrate this point, suppose we granted the strongest possible version of Fords thesis; robots eliminated all human labor, and we still had abundant food, housing, health care, education, entertainment, etc. Searle called that work an extended reflection on the implications of Moores Law and argued that Kurzweil, an accomplished high-tech inventor and controversial futurist, had left a huge gulf between the spectacular claims advanced and the weakness of the arguments given in their support. If these assignments arent designed to sharpen their thinking, or if writing is seen as a testable skill rather than a mode of discovery, maybe we should let computers write the essays as well as grade them. As Ford works his way though each economic sector, his main claim begins to bifurcate. After discussing the disappointing results of massive open online courses (MOOCs), Ford indulges his own techno-optimism, hoping against all early evidence that the highly touted MOOCs will bring high-quality education to hundreds of millions of the worlds poor. When Kurzweil complained about the review in print, Searle made quick",1,1

Snooze-Deprived Couples Rest Easy After ‘Sleep Divorce’.Jack Mazewski snores so loudly that his children sleeping down the hall can hear it.

1546,"The main reason that most folks refinance a mortgage is to take advantage of a lower interest rate and thereby end up with smaller monthly payments. (A good alternative is to keep the 30-year loan and just make extra payments regularly, in order to shrink the principal.) If you're currently carrying a mortgage at a high rate, consider spending the next few months or the year ahead increasing your credit score so that you might refinance at a lower rate. Advertisement Everyone knows that lower interest rates mean lower payments, but many people might not realize just how much of a difference a lower rate can make. You might refinance a 30-year loan into a 15-year one, ending up with larger payments, but fewer of them and less total interest to pay. Alternatively, you might switch from a 30-year fixed-rate loan into a 15-year fixed-rate loan, in order to pay the loan off sooner and pay much less in interest. If your credit score has improved considerably in recent years, you may now qualify for a significantly lower mortgage interest rate -- even if overall rates have been rising. If you can lock in an interest rate that's a percentage point lower than what you have, you may be able to save $40,000 or so over 30 years. Low credit scores keep home buyers from being offered great interest rates Opens a New Window.. If your current loan's monthly payments are too steep for you (which might be the case if you have a 15-year mortgage now), you might refinance into a fresh 30-year loan for the lower payments. include paying bills on time and paying off a lot of debt in order to lower your debt-to-available-credit ratio.Lenders like to see you owing only about 10% to 30% of the sum of all your credit limits, because it suggests that you have your debt under control and can afford to take on some more debt via the mortgage you're seeking.

Now, when headline inflation has already hit a post-Soviet low of below 4 percent, the central bank may embark on monetary easing cycle after keeping rates on hold since in July, the economy ministry predicted. Russian Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin said earlier on Thursday he expected consumer inflation to reach 3.5-3.7 percent by the end of the year. Even though Russias economic outlook has improved, the polls median forecast is still below the economy ministrys forecast of 2.1 percent this year. Respondents said the conditions were now right for the central bank to trim the key rate, now at 9 percent, at its next board meeting on Sept. 15. Russias economic prospects could improve further, however, if the central bank cuts lending rates as analysts expect. The poll also showed that the rouble is seen trading at 61.60 versus the dollar in a year from now, slightly weaker than the 61.00 forecast last month. Russian economic growth upgraded, inflation seen slowing: Reuters poll.By Zlata Garasyuta MOSCOW (Reuters) Russias economy is seen growing slightly faster this year than previously and inflation is seen slowing, a Reuters monthly poll of economists showed on Thursday. The Reuters poll showed 2017 consumer inflation at 4.1 percent, compared with last months forecast of 4.2 percent. The median forecast of 20 analysts and economists polled by Reuters in late August was for Russian 2017 gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 1.7 percent, above last months call of 1.4 percent. A resilient rouble and steady oil prices have given the central bank room for a rate cut, analysts at Bank St Petersburg said in comments with their forecasts. We think this would be among the factors that open the door for monetary policy easing by the central bank, he said.",0,4
4482,"Trump Planned Debate ‘Stunt’, Invited Bill Clinton Accusers to Rattle Hillary.Donald Trumps campaign sought to intimidate Hillary Clinton by inviting women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual abuse to sit in the family area close to the center of Sunday nights presidential debate. Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook said Hillary knew about what he called an ""awkward stunt at the beginning of the debate."" It was thwarted moments before the event went on-air when the Commission on Presidential Debates intervened to prevent it, even threatening to get security to block the women. If the plan had gone ahead, the women would have sat in the Trump family box which was in an elevated area close to the stage and in front of the cameras. We were going to put the four women in the VIP box, Trump supporter and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani was quoted as saying by the Washington Post. Bill Clinton has denied all the allegations lobbed by his accusers and was never charged with any crimes, but was impeached by the Republican House in 1998 for lying about an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The four women planned to walk in the debate hall at the same time as the former president and confront him in front of a live television audience, according to sources close to the situation. He added: ""This was a painful moment in her marriage and it was litigated very heavily 20 years ago... this was an attempt by Donald Trump to throw her off, try to distract. ""He wanted to throw Hillary Clinton off her game. ""The stunt didn't work and frankly the debate didn't work for Trump because this race fundamentally hasn't changed."" Broaddrick, who has accused the former president of rape, submitted an affidavit in 1998 denying that Bill Clinton had made nonconsensual sexual advances, which she later recanted. The newspaper said the plot was nixed by Frank J. Fahrenkopf, the debate commissions co-chairman and a former Republican National Committee chairman, who warned that security personnel would remove the women.",0,2

In November 2014, the law was expanded by a bill making it illegal for Russian political parties to receive sponsorship from, or enter into any business deals with, NGOs that have foreign-agent status. Read more The original Russian Foreign Agents Law, introduced in late 2012, obliges all NGOs that receive funding from abroad and are engaged in political activities to register as foreign agents or risk substantial fines. In mid-2016, President Vladimir Putin signed a bill into law that defined the term political activity of non-governmental organizations and exempted charity groups receiving funding from abroad from having to register as foreign agents. Media outlets that refuse to register as foreign agents would face sanctions similar to those applied to NGOs and other groups, which are currently regulated by the original foreign-agents law.

Start with our#160; Guide to budgeting and saving Opens a New Window..#160; To get the biggest gift-giving bang for your holiday budget bucks, plan a smart shopping strategy using these key techniques. Retailers who want your dollars in late October and early November are likely to entice with discounts that are better than the average for the rest of the year, even if they're not as good as some actual Black Friday deals. Corlette says that retailers want to get their dollars before Black Friday, and that's why their sales are now starting right after Halloween. ""Best Buy tried charging 10 to 20 percent lower prices online, to encourage people to shop online, but customers got mad and Best Buy got rid of that practice pretty fast,"" Corlette said. Advertisement ""What retailers know is that most shoppers have a certain amount to spend for the holidays, and whoever gets that money first wins, because when the money runs out, the consumers stop shopping,"" Candace Corlette, president of WSL, said. That means keep your receipts, and if you see what you have already bought for a lower price, get evidence of the competing lower price, demand that the original seller match that price and refund the difference, or return the item and buy it cheaper at the other store. and stretch your tight budget dollars this holiday shopping season, skip Black Friday and start hunting for bargains when black cats are still in vogue. But don't forget that those Black Friday come-ons typically come in limited quantities and require shoppers to jump through hoops by showing up at certain predawn hours and running an obstacle course of maddening crowds. Give up your allegiences and be ready to compromise by buying a cheaper brand or shopping at a lower-priced merchant.

6454,"With a presidential election year already looming, the Obama administration isnt likely to spend political capital on North Koreanot when Republicans would undoubtedly label any new moves as appeasement of a terrorist state. Conferring at a Russian military base near Lake Baikal, for the first time in a long while the North Korean leader even raised the possibility of a moratorium on nuclear weapons production and testing. Though the administration will likely send envoy Stephen Bosworth to North Korea later this year, no one expects major changes in policy or relations to result. And the pipeline, coupled with green energy projects in China, South Korea, and Japan, might begin to wean East Asia from its dependency on Middle Eastern oil and thus on the US military to secure access and protect shipping routes. To jumpstart its bedraggled economy and provide a political boost for the next leader in the year of kangsong taeguk, North Korea is suddenly in a lets-make-a-deal mode. Even if the opposition party doesnt sweep the conservatives out of power in the 2012 elections, South Korea will likely abandon Lees tough-guy approach. Restoring the line and hooking it up to Russias Trans-Siberian Railroad would connect the Korean peninsula to Europe, reduce the shipment time of goods from one end of Eurasia to the other by about two weeks, and save South Korea up to $34 to $50 per ton in shipping costs. (The Bush administration had removed North Korea from its terrorism list, and there had been hints that other longstanding sanctions might sooner or later be dropped as part of a warming in relations.) Obama came into office with a desire to shift US policy away from its Middle Eastern focus and reassert Americas importance as a Pacific power, particularly in light of Chinas growing regional influence. And North Korea could ultimately decide to make do as an economically destitute but adequately strong military power. It helps South Korean enterprises facing competition from China, even as it provides hard currency and well-paying jobs to the North. One project Park singled out for mention is an inter-Korean railroad line that would perhaps transform the Korean Peninsula into a conduit for regional trade.",1,1

Heres the thing, they absolutely could be wearing wires at the request of Bob Mueller trying to get information, but if these people are so paranoid about their conversations being recorded, then the bigger question here is what are they talking about that theyre afraid of other people, specifically a special prosecutor, overhearing? We dont know, and to be honest, thats part of the fun of it, watching these idiots squirm because they know they did things that were unethical or possibly illegal, but not knowing when that hammers going to drop and finally take them away to prison, that is about the only good thing happening with the Trump Administration today.

It makes sense for Marianne to resent anything that materially increases the danger to her husband, but those of us watching a cinematic re-creation have less of an excuse for objecting to a blurring of the line between the determined neutrality of the journalist and the unwilling engagement in the war on terror of his fellow countrymen. Not that we would or should care any less about what happens to him if he were, but its his not being one which creates the kick of indignation and pathos that gets a film like this one made. Ones chief impressions of the film are of claustrophobia and helplessness, the uselessness of peoples sympathy and hopelessness, for the most part, of the Pakistani authorities, in spite of their willingness to use torture to get information. You might be tempted to wonder what is the point of such reticence, since the audience will already know as in the film, of course, Marianne doesnt what is happening. Yet I hope that they and others will forgive me for asking the perhaps indelicate question why it is that, of all the Americans who have been killed by Islamicist fanatics in the last few years, he is the only one (so far) about whom a movie has been made?

Yet causing words to become so elastic that they may mean the opposite of what they appear to mean was precisely the goal of the 48-page memo, just released by the Obama Administration, which Bybee wrote for the Bush/Cheney White House authorizing the use of what any ordinary person, and indeed the US Criminal Code, would define as torture against captives held in Bagram, Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo and elsewhere. For as Bybee noted in that memo, the USA PATRIOT Act, in addition to eviscerating much of the Bill of Rights, also amended Section 2340A of the US law prohibiting torture to include the offense of conspiracy to commit tortureand if Bybees memo doesnt meet the definition of conspiracy, I dont know what the word conspiracy means.

I know this is too much to pay out, but I'm not sure how to transition out of a managed retirement account to a self-directed one with Motley Fool advice. And with anything that you've bought recently, the cost basis information has to come over, but for older investments, a lot of the information could get lost when you go to a new account. And I'm going to take a guess, Shawna, why you are estimating that you're going to pay about 25% of your portfolio withdrawals in retirement to your financial advisor. And you're also right because if you look at the studies that determine this 4% safe withdrawal rate (and again, other studies will have it a little higher or a little lower), most of them either didn't incorporate the fees that you pay advisors, or they assumed the fees would be like 0.2% [and that] you're investing in index funds.

Beyond Afghanistan, we must define our effort not as a boundless global war on terror but rather as a series of persistent, targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America. Even after we take these steps, one issue will remain: how to deal with those GTMO detainees who we know have participated in dangerous plots or attacks, but who cannot be prosecuted for example because the evidence against them has been compromised or is inadmissible in a court of law. Alongside the decision to put our men and women in uniform in harms way, the decision to use force against individuals or groups even against a sworn enemy of the United States is the hardest thing I do as President. We are at war with an organization that right now would kill as many Americans as they could if we did not stop them first.

Amazon said it expects revenue of $23.5 billion to $26.5 billion, with a midpoint below the $25.9 billion in revenue the Street is expecting. Despite seeing higher revenues, the loss in the third quarter was the third consecutive quarterly loss for the company, which is expanding into new sectors and building new facilities. Shares of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) rose more than 8% in after-hours trading after the Internet retail giant reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings.

Obama has agreed to a limited military action, designed and initiated to prevent a result (Muammar Qaddafi making good on his vow to turn Benghazi into a slaughtering field), rather than to produce a specific outcome (say, a Qaddafi-less Libya).

""I do expect to reach an agreement over [the state and local income tax deduction] with the high-tax lawmakers,"" Mr. Brady said, noting he had met with the group Tuesday night. GOP House Tax Chief: Changes to 401(k) Are Still on the Table.Republicans are still weighing adjustments to a popular retirement savings program, the chief of the House tax writing committee said Wednesday, contradicting President Donald Trump's statement this week that it would be unchanged in the forthcoming tax overhaul proposal. Continue Reading Below Mr. Brady's remarks at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor indicated that many aspects of the tax code were still in play just days before Republicans plan to release their proposal for rewriting it. One such proposal would cap 401(k) contributions at as little as $2,400 a year and push additional savings into so-called Roth-style IRA accounts where posttax dollars go in and money comes out tax-free after the taxpayer's retirement. Mr. Brady said Tuesday that he planned to unveil the tax bill Nov. 1 if Republicans adopt a budget as planned on Thursday. Mr. Brady was coy on many details of the tax legislation expected to be unveiled next week. Republicans are also hoping to generate significant revenue by eliminating or limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes, a proposal that has drawn sharp resistance from Republicans in high-tax states, including California, New York and New Jersey. He said the GOP tax bill would preserve the single head of household status. The GOP tax framework, released last month, would establish just three individual tax rates, with an optional fourth higher rate on the highest-income households.

Google and the Liberal Man’s Burden.Tinkerers and technopreneurs are no better suited to solve social and political crises than hacks and bureaucrats, says George Packer in the May issue of the New Yorker. In Packers estimation, the PAC is evidence that tech companies are not idealistic bands of libertarian boy-wonders; it is an industry like any other, and will employ legions of lobbyists to get what it wants in Washington, even if that means venturing off the company campus. A series of recent articles by the omniscient gentlemen of the Atlantic take the zeitgeist to its techno-libertarian extreme, arguing that in the age of Google, governments should act more like businesses, and that we may not need governments at all. Supporting gay marriage or the integration of gays in the military is no longer controversial in multinational boardrooms, and can put a positive spin on the otherwise banal corporate drive for bigger markets and more power. At face value these efforts at Google could appear to be paper tigers, small offshoots of a gigantic company whose reach runs the entire tech gambit. But Google is not a think tank, it is a manufacturer of consumer products, and however well-intentioned these projects to map illicit networks and empower citizens in fragile states may be, they will be employed to serve company interests.

Silicon Valley could have substantial weight in Washington, but Google wants to take it global.

The swamp rats would then probably seek to have their name officially changed to marsh dog or something, just to foreclose any further tie to the administration.

In all of these cases, workers were unable to slow down the process of capitalist restoration and halt the establishment of bourgeois democratic regimes by defending their own program of political revolution against the Stalinist bureaucracy - that is, to overthrow the Stalinist bureaucracy and replace it with a regime based on proletarian democracy with decisions taken in organisms of self-organization (worker's soviets or councils); to defend the economic bases of the state (social property); thus allow for the improvement of living conditions for the masses and begin an internationalist struggle for socialism. In this sense, one of the preparatory tasks preceding the (very) probable event of social explosion and maybe revolutionary process is the construction of a revolutionary party of workers, youth and all the oppressed; a party that is completely different from those that have been developed so far in the region; a party that is decidedly revolutionary and sides with the exploited and oppressed; a collective organizer that is able to learn from the past and recent struggles and thus prepare for future victories. In former bureaucratized workers' states of Eastern Europe, one question plays a major role - perhaps comparable to the question of land reform in the past: the re-nationalization of all public companies and services that were privatized during the process of capitalist restoration, without compensation and under the management of workers and the population. The main question is whether the working class, with other oppressed sectors, will manage to intervene in future social explosions and impose its own claims against the local ruling classes, imperialism and their allies in the union bureaucracies. This is especially the case in a region in which, in the 1980s many countries experienced major workers' struggles that were against the Stalinist bureaucracies, but were incapable of solving the economic and social crisis spreading across the entire socialist bloc.

Speaking of shinier concepts, it will be interesting to see if Chipotle has any insight to offer on its new TastyMade burger concept, the progress of Pizzeria Locale, or any additional color on its decision to cut the cord on ShopHouse. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG)is in the process of trying to dig its way out of a pretty big hole, and in a couple of days, we'll find out how much ground the burrito roller has left to make up. Wall Street pros see new restaurant openings and a roughly 15% uptick in comps fueling the 26% top-line growth that they are targeting. Expansion may seem to be doing little more than padding revenue growth at the expense of escalating its operating costs, but it will be a big factor in bottom-line growth if Chipotle ever gets back to its peak margin performance. Analysts also see a profit of $1.27 a share for the quarter, reversing an $0.88-a-share deficit a year ago that was the chain's first and, fortunately, only quarterly loss as a public company. Advertisement If optimists need a reality check, they may want to take a look at the two-year growth at Chipotle. It has taken a lot longer for Chipotle to bounce back from the retracting customer base following a few incidents of food-borne illnesses in late 2015. There hasn't been an incident reported in more than a year, but some former customers either don't trust Chipotle or they've moved on to shinier concepts. The heady gain would be Chipotle's strongest year-over-year quarterly growth in more than two years, but it's also important to remember where the chain was a year earlier. Revenue plunged 23% as new restaurant openings weren't enough to offset a cruel 29.7% plunge in comparable-restaurant sales. Revenue was higher despite Chipotle serving its signature",1,3

When asked about the $400 billion military budget, the $100 billion a year bill to occupy Iraq and the $300 billion deficit this year, Flyswatter invited newsmen back to the White House next month when President Bush expects to introduce two more people who obtained jobs from his 2001 tax cut package. Tax Cuts and Job Creation.Despite criticism from Democrats and a number of influential opponents of his new tax cut plan, President Bush announced that a man was employed as a result of his 2001 tax cut of $1.35 trillion. Security officials located Jesus Ramirez, a 33-year-old Mexican immigrant, who obtained his $2.95 an hour job as a gate guard after 100 homeowners at Trophy House Luxury Gated Community in Houston, Texas received refunds as a result of Bushs 2001 tax cut. Getting the federal government to increase debt so we dont have to raise taxes on our wealthy citizens is a grand idea, said Bloomberg. The plan to distribute $20 billion to the states was praised by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who looks forward to $3.8 billion in the 2003 tax cut bill to solve the citys problems. The discovery is expected to stem criticism that the wealthy were primarily the beneficiaries and the tax cut did nothing to create jobs. This proves that tax cuts create jobs and if you pass my tax cut bill this year, and next year and the next year, pretty soon, there will be jobs. Touting the trickledown effect of Ramirezs $180.00 take home pay from his 70-hour weekly paycheck, Treasury Secretary John Snowjob expects another job to turn up within weeks. With tax cuts of $18,000 each, we can finally afford someone to sit in our guard house and buzz in visitors.

The comments from Smith, who is also FedExs chairman and president, came in response to an analysts question about online sellers getting into the business of delivering goods themselves. While FedEx may eventually have to cope with online retailers making their own local deliveries, right now it is dealing with customers shifting from overnight delivery service toward cheaper ground transportation. ADVERTISEMENT Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.com, caused a stir recently when he said Amazon is exploring drone deliveries, and that sending a small package via an automated drone could be reality in a few years. FedEx CEO says drones unlikely to make big impact..................................................................................................................................................................................... Fred Smith says FedEx has several drone studies underway. Even with shippers moving away from express, cost cuts in that unit drove most of the companys profit growth. Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said FedEx executives once had to manage the shift from its old business of delivering urgent letters, which was replaced by email. Revenue and U.S. volume both fell slightly in FedExs express unit, which handles overnight shipments and is the companys largest division. The three organizations are designed to handle large-scale deliveries, including costly deliveries to residences, Smith said.

1959,"In fact, says Mountain West Associate Commissioner Javan Hedlund, the conference does not seek to break ties at the top of its football standings, even though theres a tiebreaker provision in the handbook. ADVERTISEMENT If so, Fresno State likely would slide to the Hawaii Bowl not a bad place to slide leaving the New Mexico Bowl with a second visit to University Stadium by Nevada. Three teams, Boise State, Fresno State and San Diego State, are tied in the loss column of the league standings with one apiece. The Broncos are the logical choice; theyre the Mountain Wests only nationally ranked team (22nd this week in the USA Today coaches poll), the only one with a national reputation, and they have a large and loyal if disgruntled by this years two-loss slump fan base that travels well. Each team was 1-1 against the other two, but Colorado State won a tiebreaker, having beaten fourth-place Wyoming, while the Utes and the Cougars lost to the Cowboys. The Mountain West also has tie-ins with the Sheraton Hawaii Bowl (Honolulu, Dec. 24) and the New Mexico Bowl (Albuquerque, Dec. 15). But that year, each of the tri-champions, Colorado State, Utah, Brigham Young, lost two conference games. It only makes sense that San Diego State will stay home to play in the Poinsettia Bowl.

12194,"Heath Lambert, executive director at the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, said in a video promoting the main conference that people struggling with homosexual desire are often trapped between a dominant culture that tells them to quit trying to change and Christians who say only that homosexuality is a sin. The Association of Certified Biblical Counselors is committed to the truth that homosexuality is a sinful way of life, but we are committed to more than that, Lambert said. Recently, prominent Southern Baptist churches fought non-discrimination ordinances in Fayetteville, Ark., and Plano, Texas, denounced by opponents as bathroom bills, claiming the use of sex-specific facilities such as mens and womens public restrooms, locker rooms and showers could no longer be limited on the basis of a persons biological sex. Our homosexual friends who battle against their desires need more than this, said Lambert, who teaches biblical counseling courses at both Southern Seminary and Boyce College. In its final form drafted by a resolutions committee, the statement opposed the use of procedures like gender reassignment surgery and efforts in society to validate transgender identity as morally praiseworthy. The church must speak with biblical conviction into this chaos with the clarity and love of Jesus. The Association of Certified Biblical Counselors is a 40-year-old organization that certifies biblical counselors, Christian therapists who base their practice on teaching from the Bible instead of theories developed within secular psychiatry. The Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood announced Feb. 3 it will partner with the ACBC in presentations on Transgender Confusion and Transformational Christianity preceding the main conference on Homosexuality: Compassion, Counsel, and Care for Struggling People scheduled Oct. 5-7. The National Center for Transgender Equality defines transgender people as those whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth.

State governors were told by Trump that his budget plan included a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States. Reports from officials who are familiar with Trump's budget blueprint indicate that the defense increase would be financed partly by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-defense programs. However, Treasury Secretary Steven Munchin said on Sunday that Trump's budget will not seek cuts in federal social programs such as Social Security and Medicare. President Donald Trump pledged that he would increase the military spending during the 2016 presidential campaign trail. Well, he's fulfilling that promise by seeking what he has termed a historic 9 percent increase in the military spending despite the major wars that the U.S. Military is involved in Iraq and Afghanistan and it still remains at the helm of the world's strongest military power. His outline for the military spending is just part of a budget proposal to Congress, which despite being controlled by his fellow Republicans, it will not necessarily go through.

9187,"This competition idea echoes a persistent Republican plan to privatize the profitable Northeast Corridor while still requiring Amtrak to provide long-distance service to the rest of the countrya formula that would force the agency to implode. A mix of public and private funds raised by The Northeast Maglev company (TNEM) would be used to build the rest of the route to New York. Some state associations and private companies in California and the Midwest are still slowly chugging along, but a high speed national network wont get back on track without long-term federal funding and political support. That means the maglev will compete for federal funding with the less shiny but still vitally important spiderweb of Amtrak lines stretching across the rest of the country. But this vision of an American maglev train would be a massive investment that would primarily benefit the so-called Washington elite while sucking funds from the rest of the countrys rail system. Should the privately-owned maglev succeed, it would sap Amtraks high-speed Acela Northeast Corridor, the agencys major source of revenue for maintaining the rest of the countrys less populated but still indispensable routes. But after Republicans took over Congress in 2010, funding disappeared, construction on new bullet train routes halted, and the high-speed national network dream has moldered. President Obama envisioned a high-speed rail system that would connect the whole country, and dedicated $8 billion in the 2009 stimulus bill to start building the network. Levitating Train Between DC And NYC Would Leave The Rest Of America Behind.Many Americans have long nursed a pipe dream of one day riding a super-high-speed train just like the engineering marvels that have cropped up in Japan, China, and Europe. The meager federal funding for long-distance train routes is already on the chopping block, threatening to leave many rural Americans without any mass transit options at all. This 17,000 mile rail system would not be quite as lightning-fast as a maglev train, but would link the rest of the country at or above speeds already enjoyed by Northeast Corridor Acela riders.

Indeed, as my biggest holding, Walt Disney characterizes the sort of buy-and-hold investments I love. for even more growth in the years to come set the automaker up to maintain its leadership position in a fast-growing market. The social network's 1.8 billion monthly active users give Facebook unprecedented value as a social platform and keeps them coming back. Therefore, if the company has trouble executing on its growth plans, it may miss an opportunity to reinforce its leadership position and subsequently fail to live up to the market's optimistic expectations. While I don't plan on selling any of these stocks for years to come, I would reevaluate my investment theses if any of the risks outlined here -- or any other unforeseen challenges -- disrupt these companies' potential. Find out why Facebook is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Although the Department of Health keeps the list of the state's 23 licensed medical cannabis providers confidential, Paul Jaramillo, an assistant manager at another Albuquerque dispensary, Medzen Services, said he's unaware of another local medical cannabis provider that also sells growing supplies, and a wide range of ingestion products and accessories.

Briones, who launched Minerva Canna in 2010 after closing his Purple Sage Garden Center nurseries, said the goal was to create a more ""pleasurable experience"" for patients, whether they are already knowledgeable about weed or need extra guidance.

Should New Mexico go the way of Colorado and Washington and legalize recreational marijuana, Briones thinks he would already have a solid business model in place. The medical cannabis business is big enough that New Mexico's licensed growers have had trouble keeping up with demand.

Then They Came for Me takes us through the sense of abandonment, anger, and#160;paranoia one feels in Evin, Irans decades-old, secretive torture chamber used by multiple Iranian regimes. Tales from a Torture Chamber.Random House Group In 2009, Newsweek journalist Maziar Bahari spent more than three months in Irans most notorious prison, Evin. His account is filled with intriguing and at times absurd anecdotes, like the time authorities accused Bahari of helping a spy navigate the countrythe spy was actually Jason Jones from The Daily Show who had interviewed Bahari in Tehran for a skit about the elections. A progressive who promised to open Iran up to the world, Mousavis chances looked good. Or the time Bahari heard the voices of Americans in the prison, who turned out to be the three hikers who have been in Evin for nearly two years (one of the hikers, Sarah Shourd, was released last year). In 2003, Zahra Kazemi, another Iranian-Canadian journalist, was killedin Evin after she took a picture of the prison. Mindful of the dangers of being a journalist in Iran, Bahari, whos Iranian-Canadian, produced documentaries and articles with sensitivity to the governments strict press laws.

The New Mexico Center for Law and Poverty and other groups had asked the state not to impose the new rules until there was evidence that the training and job placement programs were working. While enrollment is expected to start leveling out, state officials say the work requirements will not be a big factor in estimating future enrollment. About 12 percent of food stamp recipients in New Mexico - rather than the initial 15 percent - will be affected by the new rules, state officials said. The final rules will be published Friday, and Earnest said the delay in implementation will give the state and the 60,000 recipients who stand to be affected more time to prepare. Earnest said those concerns were heard and the state will be working with its contractor to ensure there are assessments that will look at what skills people need to develop in order to find work or what barriers might exist.

Finally, when you make the SEP contribution you must be sure that the custodian records it as applying to the 2016 tax year. ADVERTISEMENT So obtaining a valid extension to file your return also extends the date that you are allowed to make a contribution to your SEP. The returns that you plan to file determined the tax liability assuming that a $6,000 SEP contribution will be allowed as a deduction. First, to defer the contribution until October you must have a valid extension. First, a contribution to a simplified employee pension is due by the due date of your tax return for the year of the contribution, and this due date includes any extensions that you may have obtained. Also, contributions to an IRA must be made by the original (non-extended) due date of the return for the year of the contribution. If for some reason your self-prepared return is not right, you may not have made a proper estimate of your liability. If you fail to do so, then your previously filed return is not accurate, your liability is understated, and you will have tax, interest, and penalties to pay. Extension also applies to SEP..................................................................................................................................................................................... A: Your basic strategy is acceptable, but it does carry certain risks. This makes the extension invalid and your tax return late.

14077,"If the state adopts some of these measures, especially permitting California dispensaries to operate as for-profit businesses, it will end up creating rules similar to those in Colorado, another state notorious for its booming medical cannabis industry. In the aftermath of dozens of raids on dispensaries that were illegally profiting from the sale of marijuana over the last year, the medicinal marijuana industry is calling for new laws that would allow dispensaries to operate as for-profit enterprises. Despite marijuanas strictly medicinal use as far as the law is concerned, the for-profit status of Colorado dispensaries is apparent in the conspicuous commercialization of the plant there. In California, medical marijuana dispensaries are required by state law to operate as non-profit collectives of legal medical marijuana patients who simply cover the costs of distributing the plant or edible products made from it. And if it shouldnt be, is a whole new regulatory agency the best way for California to address the problem of raids on marijuana profits, especially as it works to streamline government to address a budget in severe crisis? Many industry advocates are saying the raids happened as a result of vague California laws that do not clearly define proper accounting procedures for dispensaries, allowable salary levels, or illegal profiting. I actually spent the month of January in Colorado, using some of my time there to investigate its medical marijuana laws and policies. The Sacramento Bee reports the opinion of one Hollywood attorney specializing in marijuana cases who said: Unfortunately profit isnt defined, and there is no definition of nonprofit.' In addition to clearer statutes, lawmakers, advocates, and industry leaders are calling for the creation of some kind of statewide oversight panel to regulate marijuana dispensaries. I laughed and said: #160;#160;#160;#160; So this is what we can look forward to if marijuana becomes legal for recreational use everywhere else over the next few years. Suppliers and licensed physicians who can charge for clinic visits also seem all-too-eager to cash in on the profits by making it easy to get a physicians recommendation for a medical marijuana card.

This was a focused eight-day enforcement operation over a large area, but we routinely conduct operations daily.

8293,"While there is surely bureaucratic deadwood to unload, this new system also facilitates the firing of people exposing stupid and worse behavior by DOD managers. Eliminating Bad Pentagon Habits.When the Ripon Society Forum contacted me to write an essay that identified five Defense Department programs to eliminate, I suppressed my immediate reaction: Only five? One of the effects of the new National Security Personnel System established under former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has been to make it easier for Pentagon managers to fire employees. In response, the Department and Congress exempted DOD from the statutes, including the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, that seek to force compliance with the norms of financial accountability in the private sector and even the rest of government. With all this considered, it is not enough to simply unload a few ultra high cost, underperforming mountains of unreliable complexity that the Pentagon, Congress, and defense manufacturers today palm off as weapon programs. Exemptions from accountability, approval of unrealistic cost and performance promises, harassment of informed dissent, and more do not happen on their own; they require bad managers. Our major weapons are on average older than at any time since 1946, and we routinely send units into combat with less training than we have in the past. For all this money, we get the smallest combat forces we have had at any time since 1946. Sadly, Americas defenses are festooned with programs that should be eliminated; however, killing them all off many more than just five will do very little to solve our problems. For their reputation as wonder weapons, they rely on a hypothetical construct of air-to-air warfare (beyond visual range engagement with radar directed missiles) that has failed time and time again in real war. To end the widespread decay within the Defense Department, what must first be eliminated are not bad programs, but bad habits. Finally, in their original editorial request, The Ripon Forum also asked for one program or one thing that we needed more of at the Defense Department.",1,1

That question and others are examined in two one-act plays about love by Arthur Miller, directed by Jessica Osbourne. Johnston says shes excited to play a woman with multiple personalities and doesnt find it so much of a stretch to find those within herself. The set is called, Two Way Mirror, and the first play is Some Kind of Love Story, and the second, Elegy for a Lady. In Some Kind of Love Story, a detective obsesses about an unsolved case with a prostitute with whom hes involved, believing she holds information that could solve the murder mystery. The question is whether it is love or not, because like other Arthur Miller relationships, they arent really healthy ones. The challenge for Osbourne, who usually acts or does stand-up comedy, is to find the balance, to find the light moments. These are two very different love stories, Osbourne says. Gentz says the plays are about love. The prostitute, however, has multiple-personality disorder and when the detective pushes too hard, another personality emerges.

During the presidential campaign, Trump famously mocked former President Obamas obsequious response to the IRGCs detainment of 10 U.S. Navy sailors in 2016. In a seminal statement outlining the administrations policy toward Iran, former national security advisor Gen. Michael Flynn asserted that President Trump would correct for the Obama administrations policy of appeasing the mullahs in Tehran. Trump has promised a hardline approach in response to any foreign enemy that dares to harass U.S. military personnel. The Trump administration will no longer tolerate Irans provocations that threaten our interests, said Flynn. White House officials have yet to release a statement on Irans recent provocations, however. This comes just weeks after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on the Islamic Republic.

Liberals are quick to jump in here and argue that tax cuts for the middle class and poor are necessary to offset the increasingly unequal incomes that the labor market is generating. I will be the first to acknowledge that this is a fine time to ramp up spending on infrastructure, given how much public disinvestment and deferred maintenance there has been, and given how cheap it still is for the government to borrow money to pay for it.

Something else that Fox News will never accept is the fact that undocumented immigrants commit far fewer crimes than native-born citizens. Listen, I dont know whats going on over there, whether its wacky tobacky or Latin lettuce in the break rooms or what not, but the American people right now, we want our polticians to enforce the laws. And every time there is any crime committed by an undocumented resident, Fox News goes bonkers trying to associate the crime with the persons residency status. Whats more, if Dupree thinks that drunk driving fatalities are caused by people who dont like America, then let him explain the 10,000 annual deaths caused by drunk driving American citizens. They need illegal immigrants to watch their ratings, to get their ratings back up so thats why theyre calling them patriotic. Does he really think that anyone would get drunk, then take the car out for spin because they dont like America? That would be stupid enough by itself, but its even worse when accusing people who take great risks to come to this country of not caring about it. The discussion was triggered by a clip from CNN wherein host Brooke Baldwin stated the obvious truth that its wrong to imply that all immigrants are criminals. But why let facts get in the way of a good racist narrative? But Republicans are determined to conflate these good neighbors with criminals and force them to leave their families and businesses for no reason other than their hatred of what they consider dark-skinned invaders.

967,"One reader responded that there are obvious winners: the private civilian contractors who provided security and supplies for the war effort, and were paid tens of billions of dollars by the U.S. government. He fingered an important problem we still havent come to grips with: Our military and civilian agencies seem unable to conduct massive nation-building efforts in war zones effectively, or to supervise the private contractors to whom we often outsource this job. SIGIR has documented scores of egregious scams, including one that featured a Kuwait-based U.S. contractor who reaped millions by bribing corrupt American military officers to give him contracts. The heart of the problem, said the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, is excessive reliance on badly supervised private contractors engaging in vast amounts of spending for no benefit. Speaking last week at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Bowen warned: We have yet to learn our lessons from Iraq (or Afghanistan) when it comes to nation-building under fire. One man with particular knowledge of the problem is Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, whose agency (referred to as SIGIR) has documented the failings of Iraq reconstruction and some of its most egregious contractor fraud. U.S. taxpayers lose, Iraqis dont gain, and the end result fuels Iraqi and American suspicions about the real motives behind the efforts. In 2008, at the height of the war, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that one of every five dollars spent on the Iraq war had gone to contractors; at that point, the contracts were worth about $85 billion. Anyone who has spent time in Iraq could testify to the truth of those words. Ill get back to Bowens lessons, but first a word about our runaway spending on war contractors. In Iraq, our reliance on contractors who provided many of the services that used to be carried out by grunts in the regular Army permitted the military to hold down the number of troops sent to the country.

As US and coalition forces pound ISIS targets from the air, stripping away more territory in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist group has been suffering major casualties. Federal agents believe that Mohamed Maleeh Masha, an American citizen who grew up in the Flushing area of Michigan, is now working as a physician for the Islamic State and tending to wounded jihadists.

7845,"Less conservative Baptists are often just as guilty of assuming their experience with Millennials is true across the larger Christian church, said George Bullard, a church consultant and president of The Columbia Partnership Many moderate to progressive Baptists who consider themselves open and liberated in their thinking about race, ethnicity, socioeconomics, and other issues are at the same time very myopic and parochial in seeing issues from a middle class, white, Baptist perspective, Bullard said. Wright said an African-American church can lose Millennials just as fast as a white one can if leadership doesnt provide relevant worship experiences and isnt tuned into the struggles of its people. Once those issues are dealt with if they are dealt with ethnic church leaders then have the same challenges at keeping Millennials that their white counterparts do, Ricones said: providing that sense of community and vibrancy that young people yearn for in a church. Others say the tendency to paint with a broad isnt brush not limited to Southern Baptists, and some African-American and Hispanic pastors contend that their own churches face challenges similar in seriousness to the exodus of Millennials from white churches. Many congregations are shrinking because their first-generation members still want and need Spanish as the language of worship. We also see that in Asian congregations where second- and third-generations lose the native language and it becomes a challenge for the pastor who also has to deal with generational issues, Ricones said. I would agree we project our issues and expectations on different parts of the body of the church, and there are certainly times when that can cause some trouble or misunderstanding, said Jesse Ricones, a Lubbock pastor and executive director of the Hispanic Baptist Convention of Texas.

9846,"Now that you've figured out what your immediate area (within one mile, often) can stand, you'll need to see if the adobe construction and other features of your house adds or subtracts any value. So, while there aren't any adobe homes in your immediate area, you'll still need to see for how much similarly sized houses are selling in your neighborhood. But if you have an incredibly unique house and there are few similar houses nearby, you'll need to take a slightly different approach than you would if you had one of your neighbor's houses. If those areas sell for much less than yours overall, you may be able to add some value for location. The best way to answer that question is to look at the most recent sales in the area. Remember, the only thing that determines value is what recent buyers have paid for similar houses. Try to find houses with similar features, size and condition. Adobe houses have their own appeal, but being the only one in an area also has drawbacks. But the more you know about their research, the better you'll feel about the ultimate listing and sales price. We mean ""For how much will this house sell?"" So, you would look for other neighborhoods that are similar to yours in which there is a lone adobe house. For example, if your area tends to sell in the $200Ks, but adobe houses a few miles away are selling in the $400Ks, you'll likely have to take a big adjustment for location as your immediate area won't warrant that high a price.",0,0

14623,"ADVERTISEMENT The delay between the light turning green and (Goodmans) departure was the sole basis on which Officer Landavazo stopped Goodman, according to a ruling last fall by state Court of Appeals Judge Roderick Kennedy. The ruling overturned two Albuquerque judges: Metro Court Chief Judge Henry Alaniz, who denied Goodmans first argument that the stop was illegal, and District Judge Charles Brown, who heard Goodmans appeal. The ruling said Landavazo had no legal standing to pull Goodman over, so any evidence gathered after the illegal stop could not be used against Goodman. The appeals judges said that the city obstruction law Goodman was charged with was vague enough to cause some confusion, like defining exactly what constitutes an obstruction. Behind him was Albuquerque Police Department officer Mark Landavazo, who noticed that Goodman took between five and 15 seconds to pull into the intersection when the light turned green. A fifteen-second delay, standing quite alone, without any indication as why it occurred, is no threat to public safety or free use of the citys roads, Kennedy wrote in the opinion. The crux of this case, though, is under what circumstances failing to move from a dead stop occasioned by a red light gives rise to a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. The judges ruled that all evidence taken as fruit of the illegal stop should be suppressed, effectively ending Goodmans DWI case. It is important that police know when they can and cannot pull over a driver, and this case certainly adds to that information, said Villa, Goodmans attorney. That included the evidence Landavazo used to charge Goodman with his first driving while intoxicated offense in addition to the obstruction charge. Waiting 15 seconds at a green light might be annoying for fellow motorists, but its not illegal, a fact that took two years and two criminal appeals to establish.

ADVERTISEMENT He cited insurance plans that shift more costs onto patients through higher medication copayments and deductibles that must be met before coverage kicks in, plus some Affordable Care Act exchange plans and insurance formularies that exclude pricier prescription drugs.

Meanwhile, insurance plans increasingly require patients to pay up to 30 percent of the price for the costliest drugs, rather than a fixed monthly amount.

The percentage of Republicans completely disagreeing that women should return to traditional roles rose by 16 points between 1987 and 2007 (from 25% to 41%), though the increase in this opinion among Democrats has been much greater (30 points).

In every values survey since 1987, substantial majorities have disagreed with this statement: Women should return to their traditional roles in society.

6322,"The vast majority of economists in the United States are not especially concerned about a $1.2 trillion annual health care tax; they have much less important matters to take up their time. The reason why this response is bizarre is that a bloated health care sector has pretty much the same impact on the economy whether or not the government pays for it. If the United States paid the same amount per capita for its health care as people in Canada, Germany or any other wealthy country we would be looking at long-term budget#160; surpluses, not deficits. You would think that economists would be upset over a $1.2 trillion annual tax due to the inefficiency of our health care system. It would be the same story with an insurance industry that adds $200 billion a year or more to the cost of health care in the United States. To be concrete, imagine that because of their ability to use licensing restrictions to limit the supply of doctors, physicians in the United States can charge twice as much as their counterparts in Germany or Canada (thats pretty close to the reality). In total, the difference between the cost of care in the United States and the cost in countries with comparable care, like Germany or Canada, comes to more than $1.2 trillion dollars a year. They invariably complain that health care costs are hard to control, so instead we must rely on cutbacks to public sector health care programs, like Medicare and Medicaid. From the standpoint of the economy, there is little difference between a situation in which insurers drive up the cost of care by $200 billion and a situation in which we have a more efficient system of health care delivery and the government imposes a tax on health care of $200 billion. According to the OECDs#160; health care data, this would be the annual savings to the United States if its per person health care costs were equal to those in either of these countries.

The data also showed distillate stocks in the U.S. Gulf fell to a one-year low, while overall refining rates rose in the latest week, led by a jump in East Coast refining, which is operating at a record 99.8 percent of capacity. The IEA said non-OPEC production would rise 1.4 million bpd in 2018, undermining efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers to limit global crude supplies and support prices. Advertisement On Tuesday, the IEA cut its oil demand growth forecast by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) for both 2017 and 2018. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA has jumped more than 14 percent since mid-2016 to 9.65 million bpd and is expected to grow further. Continue Reading Below Prices also remained under pressure from this weeks International Energy Agency (IEA) outlook for slower growth in global crude demand. That could mean world oil consumption may not breach 100 million bpd next year as many had expected. While the crude build of 1.9 million barrels reported by the Energy Information Administration was more than forecast, it was not as big as the increase of 6.5 million barrels reported on Tuesday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute. The urgency for countries participating in the agreement to formulate an exit strategy is increasing as oil output in the US continues to climb, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energys Global Gas Analytics in London. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 19 cents at $62.02 a barrel, having fallen by 1.5 percent on Tuesday, its largest one-day drop in a month. Overall, the report is somewhat supportive because it was not as bearish as the previous API report last night that is why we are slowly digging our way out of the downside",1,3

Emblidge said the residents didn't know their street was put on the auction block, let alone sold, until May when a title search company hired by Cheng and Lam reached out to ask if any residents had interest in buying back the property. The homeowners association has also sued the couple and the city, seeking to block Cheng and Lam from selling the street to anyone while the city appeal is pending. Scott Emblidge, the attorney for the Presidio Homeowners Association, said in a letter to the city that the owners failed to pay because the tax bill was mistakenly being sent to the address of an accountant who hadn't worked for the homeowners association since the 1980s, the Chronicle reported. That was one of several options Cheng and Lam have considered for making the investment pay off. Neighbors aren't happy.These days, the price of a San Francisco home can easily top a million dollars.

11946,"Apparently, Silone, in an attempt to mitigate the condition of his younger brother, who had been languishing in fascist prisons since 1928 (and where he would die in October 1932), passed along to Bellone information concerning the clandestine organization of the PCI in Italy and abroad. Although there is no disputing Silone's authorship of some of the letters, there is still a question concerning how long this relationship went on (a ""farewell"" letter of April 1930 to Bellone mentions a period of ten years), how serious the damage to the PCI, and Silone's motives (at least two scholars have implied questionable sexual intrigue). The epistolary relationship raises more questions than it answers, but we do know that in an attempt to extricate himself from that base and humiliating relationship, he allowed himself to be expelled from the communist movement, thereby ending his relationship with Bellone, the fascist police, and the PCI. Further muddying the waters is the curious fact that after Silone became a famous antifascist writer in the 1930s, he was never ""outed"" by the fascist regime (although documents indicate he was still being followed by fascist spies). For some time, it seems, he had carried out an exchange of letters with Guido Bellone, a police official in Rome.

10247,"Half of the prison expansion resulted from sending more people to prison due to the increased adoption of mandatory sentencing policies and prosecutorial charging decisions, while half resulted from longer prison terms. Some skeptics would argue that while the public-safety argument may apply to many offenders, there are nonetheless individuals who present such a threat to the community that even 20 years in prison is not sufficient for public protection. About a third are serving life without parole, and of the remainder, political considerationsgovernors and parole officials believing they need to demonstrate how tough they can be on individuals convicted of serious crimeshave made parole release increasingly difficult to secure in many states. Cases such as his have fueled momentum for criminal justice reform in recent years, with major presidential candidates in both parties calling for a substantial reduction in our prison population, due to a U.S. rate of incarceration thats five to ten times that of other industrialized nations. Contrast this to the current practice in the United States, where countless drug offenders are serving far lengthier terms. A growing consensus has developed around the idea that the war on drugs has relied far too heavily on excessive punishments, and that treatment interventions for substance abusers are both more effective and compassionate than long-term imprisonment. To remedy this problem, Congress and state legislative bodies should establish an upper limit of 20 years in prison as a maximum penalty, except in unusual cases such as a serial rapist who has not been amenable to treatment in prison or a mass murderer. Even the worst mass killer in the countrys history, Anders Breivik, who killed 77 people in 2011, is serving such a prison term. Norway, for example, limits prison terms to no more than 21 years, followed by a period of civil confinement when deemed necessary. The heart of the problem, as documented in a major report released by the National Research Council in 2014, is that the tripling of the prison population since 1980 was produced by changes in policy, not crime rates. So even if we were to release that entire group, we would still have a rate of incarceration far higher than that of any comparable nation. The injustice",1,1

6432,"Saudi Arabia did not cause the oil price fall, though since 2011 it has been flooding the market to offset the decrease in Iranian exports because of US sanctions. One silver lining for the Iranian economy of lower oil prices is that they will weaken the value of the riyal and make Iranian manufactures, handicrafts and agricultural produce cheaper to export. But for the latter three, which have complex economies and in the case of Russia and Iran, sizeable populations, the economic benefit of inexpensive renewable electriicity will likely outweigh the loss of oil income. While the fall in petroleum prices is hurting government budgets in Russia and Iran, ironically it may actually help workers. Everywhere, renewables are likely to put money and power in the pockets of ordinary people and workers, and may spell a weakening of the oil-based rentier state. Russian made goods may also benefit over time from the lower ruble and a smaller oil income. The lower oil prices are unlikely to hurt electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, because they are still such a tiny part of the auto market that there is room for sales to grow a great deal. As it is, the Saudis can afford to wait as fracked oil is driven out of the market because too expensive, so that they regain their market share. But the big loser will likely be shale oil producers and prospectors in the US, who probably cannot make a profit if the price falls into the 60s. It is clear that among the major losers in the fall in the price of Brent crude petroleum from $115 a barrel last summer to about $75 a barrel today are Russia, Iraq and Iran. It isnt that there is more oil being pumped, it is that the world doesnt want it as much because of cooling economies. It is mainly the government, and recipients of government subsidies, who are hurt by the oil price fall.",1,1

In the near team, airlines would be responsible getting updates from their planes every 15 minutes. Airlines and regulators spent the past year debating how much flight tracking is necessary, balancing the economic costs against reassuring travelers another plane won't disappear. Now a plan is moving forward that would require airlines, by the end of 2016, to know their jets' positions every 15 minutes. However, given that aircraft can easily fly for 20 years or more, it would be 2040 or later that every plane in the sky would have such tracking abilities. Before Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic in 2009, the airline had already had programmed its long-range aircraft to report their position every 10 minutes. A one minute reporting frequency would help pinpoint a jet within about 7 miles. Any plane with 19 seats or more, built after 2020, would be required to automatically transmit its location every minute if the plane deviated from its route, made an unusual move such as a sudden drop or climb in elevation or if a fire was detected.

Amid a string of hackings this week, Twitter said it has begun using a new security protocol that will help reduce email-based abuse and ensure that emails coming from a Twitter.com address are authentic. However, critics are calling for Twitter, which is used as a lighting-speed source for news gathering and serves as many brands face on social media, to adopt better security protocols for ensuring access to official accounts are blocked. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), for example, offers a two-step verification process for its email that sends a text message with a code to a user if someone is trying to access their account from an unfamiliar computer. A day after Burger King was attacked, Twitter issued a friendly reminder about password security, encouraging users to follow best practices for setting up passwords, which includes using at least 10 characters with both upper and lower case characters, numbers and symbols. 2 social network behind Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on its official blog late Thursday that it is using a technology called DMARC that makes it extremely unlikely that copy-cat malicious emails will be sent to users. DMARC, which stands for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting amp; Conformance, builds on established authentication protocols to give email providers a way to block email from forged domains. Twitter called the DMARC security protocol young but said it is gaining significant traction in the email community with all four major email providers, AOL, Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) already on board. Amid Hacking Headaches, Twitter Begins Using Email Authentication. Twitter says it will lessen the risk that users mistakenly give away personal information to criminals and fraudsters.

3002,"sales of big-ticket manufactured goods rose at the quickest pace in nearly three years in June, driven by surging demand for civilian aircraft. Orders of durable goods -- products designed to last at least three years, such as cars and refrigerators -- grew a seasonally adjusted 6.5% from a month earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday. ""The underlying details...suggest that, after surging in the first quarter, business equipment investment posted a decent gain in the second quarter,"" Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients. Advertisement One reason for caution: Last month's rise in durable orders was contained largely in one segment of the economy--transportation--that is volatile. Durable-goods orders have risen steadily this year: They are up 5% in the first six months compared with the same period in 2016. Businesses outside of transportation cut capital spending last month after two months of steady growth. The latest data add to evidence that economic output grew at a 2.8% annual rate in the second quarter, according to his firm's estimate. Business investment spending climbed in the second quarter overall and has grown 2.8% this year compared to the same period last year. Orders for cars fell 0.6% in June from May but are up 1.6% this year over last. Output expanded at a 1.4% pace in the first quarter, government figures show. Outside of transportation goods, orders rose 0.2%, reflecting a dip in demand on a range of goods such as cars and computers. That suggests that over the broader term, businesses and consumers are confident and able to boost spending, supporting stronger economic growth.",1,3
6380,"The Blankest Slate.In announcing his decision to nominate Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, President Obama hailed Kagan's supposed choice of the Citizens United campaign-finance case as her very first case to argue before the Court as solicitor general: I think it says a great deal about her commitment to protect our fundamental rights, because in a democracy, powerful interests must not be allowed to drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. What Kagan condemned as a profound wrong a moral injustice of the first order was the continued existence of the Clinton administration's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy on gays in the military, which implemented a provision of law adopted by a Democratic-controlled Congress. It's fair to hope that Kagan's political views have matured over the years, but there's no reason to doubt that Kagan's general political and legal outlook remains decidedly of the Left, even if she has been quiet on specific issues. My point is not to object to Kagan's elite credentials, much less to endorse Obama's populist rhetoric about the Supreme Court, but rather to highlight the curious chasm between that rhetoric and the reality of the Kagan pick. Third, Kagan, in arguing the case, abandoned precedent holding that corporate speech could be restricted because of its distorting or drowning-out effects, and she thus paved the way for the Court to overrule that precedent. Because so little is known about Kagan's legal and policy views, and because what little is known suggests that she may well indulge her sense of empathy in making legal judgments, it is especially important that the Senate conduct a thorough examination of her views. The following fall, when it had become clear that DOD believed that Kagan's barring the recruiters from the jobs office violated the Solomon Amendment, Kagan reverted to the policy of giving the military recruiters access to the jobs office while harshly condemning what she continued to stigmatize as the military's policy.

14634,"Upholding Power of the People, California Court Says Voters Can Weigh In on Citizens United.By Deirdre Fulton / Common Dreams When it ruled Monday that California lawmakers can ask for voters opinions on campaign-spending laws, the state Supreme Court underscored that the ultimate power of our government is vested in the people, Common Cause senior vice president Karen Hobert Flynn declared in the wake of the decision. We see no evidence the drafters of the California Constitution intended to deprive the Legislature of a tool other state legislatures have long used to ensure they are truly speaking on behalf of their states in the federal constitutional amendment process, Justice Kathryn M. Werdegar wrote for the states high court. The San Jose Mercury News reported on the 6-1 decision: The California Supreme Court on Monday for the most part upheld the state Legislatures power to put nonbinding, advisory measures on the ballotallowing state politicians to essentially test the waters on issues with voters without actually enacting new laws. The unprecedented legal test stems from Proposition 49, a measure removed from the November 2014 ballot by the states high court that sought voter views on whether Congress should be asked to overturn the U.S. Supreme Courts controversial 2010 Citizens United ruling on unlimited independent campaign spending. And in Washington state, backers of yet another initiative aimed at overturning Citizens United submitted 330,000 signatures to the secretary of state at the end of Decembermore than enough to qualify the measure for the 2016 ballot. By upholding the legality of Proposition 49which would ask voters whether Congress should propose an amendment overturning the 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision known as Citizens Unitedthe court spoke directly to the question we have faced since the Citizens United ruling, Hobert Flynn continued. Long-standing historical practice among the states demonstrates a common understanding that legislatures may formally consult with and seek nonbinding input from their constituents on matters relevant to the federal constitutional amendment process, the ruling read in part. The development paves the way for the state legislature to put this issue before voters statewide in 2016. Hundreds of thousands of Californians",1,1

Yet, anger expression undermined female holdouts: Participants became significantly more confident in their original verdicts after female holdouts expressed angereven though they were expressing the exact same opinion and emotion as the male holdouts. Participants confidence in their own verdict dropped significantly, however, after male holdouts expressed anger, the researchers write. They suggest the belief that people would have listened to her impassioned argument, had she been a man is, in many cases, valid. The holdout who disagreed made their case in a tone that was either angry, fearful, or emotionally neutral and had either a male or female name.

The truth is that we actually have access to very little evidence about that night, yet every man who has emailed me is convinced that all the facts are out there and only a feminist fool would believe otherwise. These men yes, they all were from men explained to me that the facts show without question that nothing happened that night, which I would have known if I were not so busy trying to further my feminist agenda. My anger at the way the media humanized these men as victims and dehumanized the woman as the perpetrator of a lie clearly stood out from the rest of the show. And to top it all, not one lacrosse player has come forward to express any regret at that nights events or offered any apology for being part of a drunken strip party that humiliated and degraded two black women.

The first real sign that something was going wrong in his mind, though I did not understand this at the time, came in the summer of 2001, six months before his breakdown when I took him and his younger brother Alex on holiday to Venice. After all, he knew all too much from the inside about what it was like to suffer a psychosis and live for years in a mental hospital, things that most people regard with fear and know little about. As he returned to a more rational view of the world, he spoke to me of a deep sense of failure and inadequacy, knowing that his friends from school were getting jobs, marrying and having children, while he sat wrapped in a blanket in the locked ward of a mental hospital. Usually people were full of praise for Henrys work, but on this occasion the women looked perplexed by what he had drawn, and I could see why when I looked at his sketchpad which was covered with meandering lines. At the time Henry was rescued from Newhaven estuary, I was part of the ill-informed majority who believe that schizophrenia and bipolar depression are distinct diagnosable illnesses like typhoid or polio, though in fact they are a set of fluid symptoms that may change over time. (When people like Prince Harry call for greater openness about mental health they are generally speaking, though they may not realise it, talking about something less incapacitating than serious psychosis in which a persons whole personality is capsized. As the night went on, I talked to the tree about many things it seemed to know about me: where I had gone, who my friends were and who loved me. It is very difficult to explain what it is like to have a psychosis and to be locked up in a mental hospital, run away, almost drown and spend long days in an isolation cell.

But one would have to strain, it seems to me, to explain how the incarceration of African-Americans could have increased so much more rapidly in the past 35 years than that of other Americans, if the tough on crime rhetoric of the post-corrective era werent at least to some extent an epiphenomenon of a new social policy in the US fundamentally concerned with perpetuating the racial inequality that is coeval with the settlement of the new world. This is what it would be, as he insists must be done, to change the terms of the debate: to stop pretending that the growth of the prison system over the past few decades is a natural response to spontaneous changes for the worse in the habits of criminals, to stop pretending that the various numbers adduced to make the disproportionate imprisonment of blacks look inevitable are any more objective, any less subject to debate, than any other secretion of system-preserving ideology. On the most pessimistic reading of this account of late-20th-century racial politics, one could suppose that it was precisely as a consequence of blacks having gained the freedom to leave the ghetto, as a result of the civil rights struggle, that something more coercively segregative had to move in to take its place. And, for better or worse (or, more precisely, worse), the uses to which IQs and other convenient numbers are put are of central importance in understanding how the prison system and its government and media supporters use what look like cold hard facts in order to make the demographics of imprisonment look inevitable.

For example, an Interiors Office of Inspector General report published in January 2016 found a long-term pattern of sexual harassment and hostile work environment at the Grand Canyon District National Park Service. The supervisory response to my three sexual harassment incidents was one of minimizing my experience and attempting to resolve the situation with a mere apology from the perpetrator instead of imposing more appropriate disciplinary action, Martin told lawmakers. We are also fixing the problem of victims being afraid of retaliation or inaction by codifying the right for victims to report abuse to any manager in any location across the Service, and by bringing on an independent, investigative partner. Zinke and National Park Service (NPS) acting director Mike Reynolds held an all-staff meeting at Grand Canyon National Park where they unveiled a series of policies aimed at preventing and rooting out sexual harassment. The Interior Department also released the results of a survey showing that 38 percent of NPS employees experienced harassment or discrimination of some kind while on the job, according to the release. At a June 2016 hearing, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform reported more than 20 claims of sexual harassment and misconduct were reported at offices in the Grand Canyon River District and Canaveral National Seashore during the past 15 years. Yet, [former NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis] has not fired any of the perpetrators involved despite NPSs zero tolerance policy, the committee outlined. Ive removed a number of people who were abusive or acted improperly that other administrations were too afraid to or just turned a blind eye to, Zinke said in a statement.

6912,"Bernanke noted earlier in prepared comments that its too soon the economic recovery is still too weak to consider scaling back the Feds $85 billion a month in bond purchases. Continue Reading Below Stock markets are anxiously awaiting any hint that Bernanke and his fellow Fed policy makers are considering winding down their massive bond buying programs and perhaps even raising interest rates. Indeed, in response to a question Wednesday during testimony before Congress, Bernanke said the Fed would consider easing its bond buying purchases over the course of the central banks next several meetings. Economists and stock market analysts alike believe there could be a sharp selloff from the record highs stock markets have reached in recent months whenever the Fed tips its hand about scaling back on bond purchases or possibly raising interest rates. Bernanke also warned that a premature tightening of monetary policy could lead interest rates to rise temporarily but would also carry a substantial risk of slowing or ending the economic recovery and causing inflation to fall further. Apparently lost in Bernankes comments was his remark that the Fed would also consider buying more bonds if economic data warrants such a move. He reiterated the Feds long-held position that the FOMC expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke confirmed Wednesday what most people expected -- the central bank will continue its easy money policies until labor markets strengthen and the economic recovery gains real momentum. In response to questions from several Congressional panel members, Bernanke said a bi-partisan grand bargain on budget deficits that would include a mix of new taxes and spending cuts would be confidence inspiring and would make it easier for the Fed to unwind its bond purchasing program. The Fed chief also addressed critics who argue the easy money policies hurt savers by keeping interest rates low. While the bond buying programs could be eased at any time, the Fed has promised to keep interest rates at record low levels until the unemployment rate hits 6.5%. The bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, are intended to keep",1,3

Along with heading for urgent care or the emergency room, he recommends first aid for such injuries follow the protocol of the acronym, PRICE, or protection, (like a sling), rest, ice, compression and elevation. Cudney-Black says the program Stabler created took her back to the basics so they could watch her body mechanics as she went through exercises. If the injury flares up treat it as if its acute for the first week or two, he says, adding heat before exercise and ice after. Yoga can help build balance, strength and body awareness to help prevent reinjury: Hot yoga is popular for a good reason. Swimming is a good choice for someone reconditioning after an injury. A good rule of thumb is to increase the frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise, or FITT, by 10 percent until that workout feels comfortable, he adds. Stabler says working on core strength, balance and body dynamics isnt a quick fix. In their hurry to keep up with friends or to reach a goal quickly, athletes sometimes forget that first achieving a sound level of fitness will increase the likelihood that they will meet or exceed the goal.

Many investors and financial analysts believe the hapless commission and the ill-planned meeting are just props to allow Mr. Maduro to blame the failure of negotiations to stem the default on U.S. sanctions. But since Mr. El Aissami is on the kingpins list, it is unlikely anyone will turn up at the meeting and risk breaking U.S. laws that prohibit business dealings with people officially classified as such. U.S. officials and former colleagues say Mr. El Aissami accrued power by using proceeds from drug trafficking and illegal passport sales to build a parallel intelligence network to intimidate and repress opponents. The composition of the commission -- none have significant training in economics or finance and two are targets of U.S. sanctions -- suggest to some observers that the government isn't really seeking to restructure its debt, but rather to create a situation in which it can blame a default on the sanctions. A fourth fund manager said he was banned from even emailing by his firm's compliance department, for fear of breaking the U.S. ban on business dealings with Mr. El Aissami or Mr. Zerpa. Advertisement In a televised address last week, Mr. El Aissami called on investors to discuss a restructuring at a meeting in Caracas on Nov. 13, which happens to be the deadline for almost $300 million in outstanding bond interest payments.

The future of the nation is being decided in Qom, among the clerical leaders of Iranian Shia Islam; and one of the most influential of them perhaps the closest of all the ayatollahs to President Ahmadinejad is silent. But we can be sure that he remains in constant contact with the president whose dubious re-election provoked the street demonstrations, killings, and subsequent judicial tortures and deaths in Iran. For if Ahmadinejad has a mentor in Iran, it is not Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, but Mesbah-Yazdi, the 75-year-old conservative oligarch who has enormous power over the Revolutionary Guards and Basiji militia. We like to believe and newspapers and television like us to believe that the battle for Iran is being fought on the streets of Tehran, of Isfahan, of Najafabad.

The attack came as Israel further tightened security around the country, highlighted by the construction of a barrier separating Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in east Jerusalem. Yoram Halevy, a police commander in southern Israel, said that in addition to the knife and gun he entered with, the attacker also snatched a weapon from the soldier he killed. The attack was one of the most serious incidents amid near-daily bouts of violence that has hit Israel and the Palestinian territories over the past month. Security camera footage from the bus station aired on Israeli TV showed what appeared to be a civilian shooting the attacker as soldiers and civilians crouched for cover nearby. Israeli media showed footage of a blood-streaked floor and rows of ambulances outside the bus station. A foreigner was shot by police",0,0

Send that force on a noble mission of peace to separate and disengage the two sides, like we did in Sinai; let both peoples live without fear of the other while they contemplate peace. Mr. President, only one tenth of the force you mobilized in Iraq can bring the surest first step to peace in the Holy Land. Let the two sides start by cleaning up their own societies and controlling the hatred in their midst; help both sides to free their internal resources to address their internal problems with incitement; let them establish their own internal peace before they can make peace with their decades old adversary. The Holy Land has no oil for us to covet, but peace in the Holy Land is the key to our success in the Arab and Moslem worlds. Only one tenth of the force we sent to Iraq should suffice in the Holy Land. But your efforts to bring peace to the Middle East pale by comparison and many of us are convinced you can do more. You mobilized a lethal force, hundreds of thousands of our finest troops, to fight a war in Iraq; you spent billions of dollars and committed the might and wealth of this nation to remove a tyrant and change his regime.

Romney will enter the late primaries because he is concerned that Rule 40 B will be changed to allow only those who won some delegates from voters in the states to be considered and because he might stand a better chance of chiseling delegates from Trump in late winner take all primaries than the hapless Rubio. In 2016, Trump doesnt need the racketeers money because he has the Republican grassroots, but the racketeers have one last play: fix the Rules of the Conventions. Much in the way the RNC stacked the galleries with anti-Trump partisans in the last two debates, anti-Trump quislings are be planted in various delegations that will be free to betray Trump on subsequent ballots. Also, the goal of the extended nomination process will be to make it so either no one gets to eight states (or what ever number the establishment changes it to) Then, under the guise of letting the voters be heard, the Rules committee will make a more lax Rule 40.

Interestingly, despite the fact that Jews were far more targeted than Muslims, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, speaking at the Muslim Advocates annual dinner on December 3, 2015, focused on anti-Muslim acts, saying, Since 9/11, weve had over 1,000 investigations into acts of anti-Muslim hatred, including rhetoric and bigoted actions, with over 45 prosecutions arising out of that. For starters, the largest percentage of hate crimes against people based on religious affiliation are committed against Jews. According to 2014 FBI stats, 63% of all hate crimes against a religious group were committed against Jews, compared to 11% against Muslims. 834 hate crimes were counted against Jews; 318 against Muslims, and 63 against Catholics. Hate crimes against Jews rose 9% from 2015. After the precipitous drop from the anti-Jewish crimes to the anti-Muslim crimes, there was another huge drop to the third-most targeted group: Catholics, at 4%.

(1) Except as provided in subsection (2), it is a rebuttable presumption in a civil or criminal case that an individual who uses deadly force or force other than deadly force under section 2 of the self-defense act has an honest and reasonable belief that imminent death of, sexual assault of, or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another individual will occur if both of the following apply: (a) The individual against whom deadly force or force other than deadly force is used is in the process of breaking and entering a dwelling or business premises or committing home invasion or has broken and entered a dwelling or business premises or committed home invasion and is still present in the dwelling or business premises, or is unlawfully attempting to remove another individual from a dwelling, business premises, or occupied vehicle against his or her will. #160;The two strongest arguments counter to self-defense were: (1) Wafers early and repeated references to the shooting as an accident, including his claims that he was unaware the shotgun was loaded, only to later claim the shooting was an act of self-defense. The prosecution in this trial also requested and received a jury instruction on prior false exculpatory statements as consciousness of guilt evidence, and that certainly could not have helped the jury lean towards self-defense if they believed Wafers early claims of accident were an effort to escape legal jeopardy.

Markwayne Mullin, a 39-year-old Oklahoma Republican who entered Congress with Kennedy four years ago and says he disagrees with the Massachusetts Democrat on almost everything. While the technology may be new, his support for the Obama-era health care law and more services for the poor are familiar Kennedy territory.

There just arent enough domestic workers who want to do this type of work, says Landfried. Aside from border patrols, the other efforts in place aimed at making Arizona inhospitable to illegal immigrants has also made it less friendly to small businesses, says Landfried. Jones agrees that SB 1070 has made many small business owners uncomfortable, because it threatens business owners with the possibility of getting shut down if its proven that they employ an illegal immigrant even if the worker had successfully gotten past the states E-Verify worker identification program. Garrick Taylor, the senior vice president of government relations and communication for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says that the bureaucratic red tape surrounding the H-2A visa for agricultural workers is so cumbersome that by the time businesses are able to accept workers, their need has passed. Landfried says that estimates suggest that between 100,000 and 250,000 people have left Arizona due to the current immigration policies. If we can achieve effective visa reform, we can attract the best and the brightest and allow them to contribute not only to the success of American companies, but to American companies broadly as well.Has the Pressure to Keep the Border Safe Hurt the Economy? Regarding construction, Jones says peaks in needing labor come on a weekly basis a timeline that he says doesnt work with the current visa process. Even if you are a Hispanic U.S. citizen, and you know you could move to Arizona for a job opportunity would you want to move your family to a place that has the perception of not being friendly to you? Arizonas STEM businesses are also in need of highly trained workers, Taylor says. While the crowd that gathered to hear McCain speak was less than enthusiastic about the idea, some local entrepreneurs say they gladly welcome the promise of immigration reform. The SB 1070 Act, which gives law enforcement officials the right to stop individuals if they believe the person in question might be an illegal immigrant, has dramatically damaged the business environment in Arizona, according to Landfried.",1,3
2762,"WEDNESDAY, Sept. 6, 2017 A new cancer pen promises to help surgeons immediately detect and completely remove cancerous tumor tissue, without having to send samples off to a lab for testing while the patient languishes on the table. The MasSpec Pen is a hand-held device that allows doctors to test in real-time whether tissue is cancerous or not, delivering results in about 10 seconds, researchers report. As a surgeon who battles the unpredictability of margin assessment on a weekly basis, I believe the MasSpec Pen has great potential to revolutionize the field of surgical oncology, and I am anxious to see what it can do in clinical practice, Deutsch said. 'Cancer pen' could help surgeons spot tumor cells in seconds. The pen will make it easier to surgically clear out all the cancer cells surrounding a tumor, explained senior researcher Livia Eberlin, an assistant professor of chemistry with the University of Texas at Austin. He also hopes future studies will examine whether cancer treatments like radiation therapy or chemotherapy could throw off the results from the mass spectrometer. Most surgeons have had the misfortune of finding out that tissues initially judged cancer-free by pathologists during an operation were later ruled positive for cancer during follow-up analysis, Deutsch said. Cancer tissues and normal tissues have very different molecular profiles that we use to diagnose disease, Eberlin said. Cancer surgeons these days send tissue samples off to an in-hospital pathology lab during the operation to see if they have removed all the tumor, Lin said. The pens accuracy currently stands at more than 96 percent, based on tests that used tissues removed from 253 cancer patients. The device can even determine different types and even subtypes of cancer, since each cancer produces a unique set of biomarkers that act as its molecular fingerprints, the researchers added. Surgeons hold the tip of the pen against the patients tissue, where it quickly releases and then recaptures a tiny drop of water, Eberlin said.",0,4

With Trumps pardon of Arpaio, a message has been sent: When it comes to police brutality of the kind Arpaio perpetuated for decades, the Trump administration wont simply be complicit in it. Throughout his time as sheriff, a White House statement bleated, Arpaio continued his lifes work of protecting the public from the scourges of crime and illegal immigration. For more than 20 years, Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona terrorized Latino communities, harassed immigrants, and made life a living hell for prisoners in his care in order to build a reputation as Americas toughest sheriff. Trump’s Disturbing Pardon of Joe Arpaio.During a speech to a group of police officers in July, President Trump returned to one of his favorite themes of the campaign season: violence. To the law, Arpaio is a convicted criminal who built his career on denying the constitutional and human rights of the most vulnerable among us. Back in 2011, a federal judge ordered Arpaio to stop targeting and detaining Latinos just to inquire about their immigration status. Empowering law enforcement to keep our streets free of crime and violence means supporting racial profiling. Nevertheless, Arpaio persisted for another 18 months, insisting that his racial profiling was lawful. He codified this promise once he became president in the Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community section of the White House website. Yet the president just proved that when it comes to endorsing police brutality, especially against communities of color, hes dead serious. For the president, it seems, standing up for law enforcement includes allowing officers to subvert the rule of law to commit acts of brutality with impunity.",1,1

The August jobs report will be the highlight of next weeks economic calendar as investors and Federal Reserve policy makers look for sustained strength in U.S. labor markets. A September rate hike was all-but certain a few weeks ago as a summers-worth of positive economic data seemed to have convinced most FOMC members that the U.S. economy was healthy enough to absorb a rate hike and the higher borrowing costs that will follow.

After a long career studying urban societies and how they function, Sarkis believes were beyond thinking about so-called world cities like Tokyo, London and New York as being the main places where ideas and culture cross borders. Maybe we can come up with a much broader list of categories rather than talk about 'urban' versus 'rural,' and consider a broader range of possible ways of living together, he says. I don't think defining what is urban is clear anymore.#160;What makes a world city? This concept has been introduced in science fiction, as was the term ecumenopolis, introduced in 1967 by the Greek city planner Constantinos Dioxiadis, who believed that urbanization and population growth would in time lead to a world where major cities have fused into a single entity. For me, it is one world and I always yearn in my work to express it as such.#160;These differences from which we form our identities are too small for them to matter. The world is in effect becoming one city, Sarkis contends, connected by virtual realities if not physical ones. Maybe there's another way we can talk about it, he says when I ask him what the modern city will look like. Get ready for city living, whether you like it or not.CAMBRIDGE, Mass. The United Nations reports that more than 50 percent of the world [population] is in cities, which is quite problematic because it excludes another fifty percent who are actually as connected with the use of Internet and accessibility of flight. Using the term city misses the fact that you can be in the most remote town outside of Edmonton, Canada and still be very connected.

3772,"Paris has already suggested that new European sanctions against Iran could be discussed over its missile tests, something EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini seemed to dismiss on Tuesday, keen not to raise risks to the hard-won deal that curbed Irans disputed nuclear activity. Despite EU caution, France pursues tough line on Iran missile program.By John Irish PARIS (Reuters) France said on Wednesday it wanted an uncompromising dialogue with Iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from Tehrans 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Trump has also dealt a blow to Irans nuclear deal agreed with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States under Obama by decertifying Iranian compliance with its terms, contradicting the findings of U.N. nuclear inspectors. The U.S. Congress now has until mid-December to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on Iran that had been lifted in exchange for limiting its nuclear program in ways meant to prevent it developing an atomic bomb. President Donald Trump, who has resumed a confrontational U.S. approach to Iran in contrast with predecessor Barack Obamas policy of detente, has said Iranian missile activity should be curbed and wants to punish Tehran over its role in Yemen and Syria. On Sunday, Iran rejected a call by French President Emmanuel Macron for talks on its missiles, saying they were defensive in nature and had nothing to do with its nuclear energy work. France wishes to examine all the diplomatic options: a frank and uncompromising political dialogue with Iran; investigations by the U.N. General Secretariat; if necessary, new European sanctions against Iranian entities or individuals involved in the ballistic program; and finally opening a negotiation on the subject, she said. Any EU-wide sanctions action requires the unanimity of all 28 member states but there is no consensus on new punitive steps against Iran, a fact made clear by Mogherini on Monday. But the EU, which normally coordinates closely with Washington on international sanctions, has been lobbying hard to keep the nuclear pact alive, saying it should be kept separate from missile and regional security matters.",0,4

If a 13-year-old taking a picture of herself is the equal of a predator taking a picture of children in sex acts, says Danah Boyd of Harvards Berkman Center for Internet and Society, we wont have the tools to go after the people we need to go after. If the sexting scandal has done anything, its gotten parents to take a peek at the pixels just as theyve turned MySpace into OurSpace.

Eighteen-year-old Jessica Logan of Ohio committed suicide after her boyfriend put her naked photos out in public, but it was girls who bullied and harassed her. We even have an 18-year-old who sent nude photos of his girlfriend now listed as a sex offender alongside child rapists. As Boyd says, If you look at the reasons why they share naked content, one is a form of flirting. Over the last months, sexting, that spicy combo of sex and texting, has created something between a moral panic and a reprise of Trouble in River City. Its mostly girls pictures that get passed around. The photo that is sent in a reckless or mean moment can travel around the world as fast as Susan Boyle singing I Dreamed a Dream.

Fort Worth also disagreed with the national church on the blessing of same-sex unions, as well as the 2003 consecration of an openly homosexual man as bishop of New Hampshire. Five of the Fort Worth diocese's 56 congregations and an estimated 4,000 of its 19,000 members will remain with the church, according to church officials. The food stamp program now has more than 30 million people enrolled, an increase of 9.5 percent from 2006, and half of all babies receive supplemental nutrition from the Women, Infants and Children program, according to the report. Hunger in America continued to rise last year, and participation in the food-stamp program is approaching record highs, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Fort Worth and Quincy are the only two of the Episcopal Church's 110 dioceses that do not allow women to be ordained.

Earlier this fall, the ministry cut 46 other staff positions by outsourcing the department that filled orders and distributed books. The ministry founded by religious broadcaster James Dobson also will stop publishing four of its eight magazines. The Diocese of Fort Worth, Texas, became the fourth to secede from the Episcopal Church when delegates voted to align with a more conservative branch of the Anglican Communion.

Last year, Lien, a 10th-grader at Southwest Learning Center, came in second place in the same competition. - The ending is very technical - You have to play it at the quick speed that it's supposed to be played at,"" he said. 1 and Downs will perform the first movement of Max Bruch's Concerto No. LIEN: Pianist will perform with NM Philharmonic A member of the Albuquerque Youth Symphony, Downs said she's been studying violin since age 6.

692,"The Wall St. Journal: Americas strapped states and cities took another hit Wednesday, with California seeing tepid demand for its latest bond sale and other governments pulling about $700 million worth of borrowing deals this week as investors continued stepping away from the municipal bond market. Californias $10 billion bond sale this week was seen as a test of access for governments to the bond markets, and the middling interest signaled that municipalities could have to pay more to attract investors. The normally staid market has grown volatile the past week, posting its sharpest selloff in nearly two years, as investors demand higher interest rates to buy paper issued by states, cities and counties to finance their operations. Arnold Schwarzenegger has extended his seven years of destruction by wiping out the market for bonds, not just for California, but other states and cities. The state further jolted the market by delaying the close of the bond sale, citing a lawsuit filed Tuesday that challenges a separate tactic the state is using to raise funds. This creates a fear among individual investors and probably could hurt the state in terms of paying a higher borrowing cost than if theyd done a deal at a different time.

So while some unions look the other way when encountered with environmental problems, union workers clearly have the protection that nonunion workers lack to identify problems that are not just dangerous to local communities, but dangerous to their health. GenOn also had a rule prohibiting posting of information about union activity and rules not allowing workers to wear buttons in support of workers, according to the union's filing. He developed safety and whistleblower training programs so that workers could use their union protection to point out environmental problems. GenOn allegedly prohibits its workers from talking to anyone about their working conditions or pay, which would be in clear violation of federal labor law.

He thinks government support programs for low-wage workerslike those who work at his own restaurant franchisesare a disincentive to work, despite the fact that many fast food and retail workers wages are so low that they qualify for food stamps, public housing assistance and Medicaid, said Chris Shelton, president of the Communications Workers of America. He also opposes the Obama-era joint employer standard, which would make it easier to hold corporations, like McDonalds and CKE, responsible for violations committed by those companies contractors and franchisees. Puzder has pointedly opposed regulatory changes to protect workers rights that have been pushed by President Barack Obama, and he certainly will try to roll back whatever gains progressives have made at any level of government that he can influence.

10167,"One of the oft-cited arguments for legalizing marijuana on the progressive side of the aisle is that legalizing it will open up new sources of revenue for the state, as marijuana is a highly profitable cash crop, and even a small tax on it would probably bring in a significant sum of revenue.#160; However, since no existing marijuana tax currently exists on Californias books, the creation of such a thing would first have to pass a 2/3 majority vote in Californias legislature if Proposition 26 is passed. Thus, the issue of marijuana legalization, while it would satisfy the demands of its more libertarian-minded supporters, would likely end in disappointment for progressives who would like to see the drug taxed and regulated, especially given that regulation is costly, and without revenue, unlikely to be popular and/or feasible.#160; At no other time, then, is a critical outlook more necessary in critically evaluating the various initiatives currently in play on Californias ballot. Tax relief and marijuana legalization both have compelling arguments to back them up, but for California voters, the issue in this case may be that they have to pick one or the other. And given that anti-tax sentiment in the legislature has historically frustrated this sort of effort, that would in effect make marijuana perhaps the only untaxed drug in California, which, while it would produce a boom in the marijuana industry, would also give purveyors of tobacco and alcohol incentives to seek similar tax breaks for their good. The reason for this is the existence of Propositions 25 and 26, which would respectively permit the California legislature to pass a budget by simple majority vote while simultaneously requiring that all taxation votes meet a 2/3 majority. The legalization element, however, is not the problematic one rather, the regulation and taxation elements are likely to clash with the anti-prohibition coalition supporting the initiative. Even on their own, these two measures will put the legislature in a very precarious position, with the spending portion of the budget subject to simple majority, while revenue-raising is still left difficult. Ballot propositions 19, 25, and 26 present California voters with some noticeably contradictory elements.",0,0
12967,"That pattern of humility and receptivity in his papal life finds one of its roots in Wojtyas providential relationship to Jan Tyranowski, to whom John Paul remained profoundly grateful, sixty years after they first met.

Its not difficult to trace the influence of Jan Tyranowski on the papal teaching of the young man he helped to discern a vocation to the priesthood. Jan Tyranowski, the tailor with an eighth-grade education, said yes, and began to organize the young men of the parish into what he called Living Rosary groups: fifteen teenagers or young adults (for the fifteen mysteries of the Rosary as then constituted), each group led by a more mature young man to whom Tyranowski gave spiritual direction. But when the news came that the mystically-gifted Dbniki tailor at whose tomb Ive frequently prayed was now Venerable Jan Tyranowski, it struck me that his tutelage and the Tyranowski-Wojtya relationship remind us of something important about the papacy.

We who pay taxes and health care costs are burdened by the cost of educating, providing medical care at ERs, and many other services for which illegal immigrants still manage to qualify.

4368,"Swedish police in the city of Trollhattan were in the fight of their lives when they were attacked by up to a hundred disguised migrant youths armed with sticks and bats during a riot in Kronogrden suburb last Thursday. Police think that the riots were started up by an event earlier in the week, when children were taken away from their parents by protective services. The masked migrant youths went after the officers and attacked them during the second night of riots in the area. One resident who witnessed the riots described them: They drove a police car and threw stones at it. Bad move on his part, as the guard was then assaulted by the youths who threw stones at him. Even with all that, only one suspect was arrested in connection with the riots. The migrant youth went after the officers vehicles, slashing the tires of two police cars. The onslaught on police in migrant-heavy suburbs has become commonplace in Sweden in past years. The riot is said to have viciously intensified after various youths tried to set a tire on fire in the street and a security guard stepped in to put out the fire.

You might compare the two pharmaceutical companies' dividend payout ratios and think that Pfizer's dividend could be in trouble. There's a legitimate case to be made that Pfizer's management now views its dividend program as a more important part of its overall investing thesis than Bristol-Myers Squibb's management does. But Pfizer appears to be the better dividend stock now. Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, used less than 58% of its earnings to fund its dividend program.

Meanwhile, it is clear that an attack on Iran, while it might possibly lead to a quick jingoistic boost in support for the president that could save him from a Democratic Congress, would cause such a global economic disaster and such a military catastrophe for the U.S. over the longer run that Republicans could be destroyed as a political party for years to come.

Instilling further doubts about OPEC's ability to cut output, sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait may agree to resume oil production from jointly held fields in a neutral zone between the two countries. Market watchers had said OPEC's decision to cut output marked an about-face for Saudi Arabia, which has been battling to keep market share for the past two years by selling more, if cheaper, barrels rather than bolstering prices.

Theres something else St. Nick learned from his dad when it comes to dressing in red: Dont make promises. And one time, when his father was feeling ill at Christmastime and forbidden by his wife to don the suit, Nick did so. The 1955 Christmas was so memorable that Stephens remembered his best gift that year a pair of roller skates and how he skated with some Yuba City kids seemingly stunned that Santa had found them two-dozen miles from their homes. Ivan Stephens, who passed away in 1999, assumed his role as Santa well into his 80s, his son recalled. This St. Nick has learned 21st century kids dont ask for roller skates anymore: video games, big-screen TVs and puppies are the top choices, although some kids asked if Santa could get their dads home from overseas. As one of Santas helpers this Christmas season, Stephens estimated hes had somewhere between 450 and 500 youngsters sit on his lap and not a single one peed.

7460,"Obamas abandoning of a public option for national health insurance will guarantee that the health care mega-corporations will continue to price-gouge Medicare, handing the business elite the argument: the giant U.S. deficit means that we can no longer afford large social programs. A plan of action to accomplish this might look something like this: 1) Pass REAL health reform: nationalized, single-payer health care without the insurance companies, eliminate the Medicare windfall profits for the pharmaceutical companies by operating these companies as public utilities and have the government set affordable prices for all medications. Corporate-orientated Time Magazine was more blunt: The real budget problems lie in the long-term programs, such as Medicare and Social Security its one thing to spend our way out of a recession. Obama also used the deficit news to promote health care reform and correctly blamed much of the deficit on the high cost of Medicare, itself the result of outrageous prices that corporations charge for health care. To combat the immense rage resulting from the bailouts, media outlets recently published reports of U.S. taxpayers profiting from the bailout as select corporations repaid their portion with interest, though the profits were minuscule and hardly attention worthy. The profits that some giant banks are reporting are direct results of the bailout, itself a gigantic forced borrowing from working Americans, who will be paying the debt with their cherished social programs unless they mount an organized protest. 2) Pass the Employee Free Choice Act: unionized workers make more money, and will thus pay more in taxes to help reduce the deficit. Another reason for the deficit is the bank bailouts, yet another policy of Bushs that Obama continued and escalated. They rightfully fear that foreign investors most notably China and Japan will quit feeding the American debt machine unless the deficit is drastically reduced. Workers are not so naive to think that the Bush/Obama bailouts the fiscal crime of the century will earn them profits.

And its hard to imagine a better repurposing of a song that already captures so much of the impossible-to-define joys of childhood than what The North Face and the team at Sherpas Cinema have been able to pull off with Imagination. One other unexpected byproduct from Burnetts involvement is a Bear and a Banjo track co-written by none other than Bob Dylan, who lent Burnett some stray lyrics for Poo Bear to try his hand. The song features production from Burnett, who jokes that his main job was to slow down the hyper-prolific dynamic between Gustadt and Poo Bear. #160;That song also has pre-adolescent ties, with its core melody built heavily around a sample from an obscure 1950s group called Six Boys in Trouble, whose youthful take on soul predated Jackson 5 by more than a decade.

When they buy their first pack of cigarettes or see someone elses pack on the counter, if they are disgusted with the image that is a good thing -- we want to protect our kids from a deadly drug addiction. He added that kids dont start with generic cigarettes, they pick up the brands theyve seen marketed as cool, but if they now see consequences of the habit, it acts as a deterrent. Lawyers for the tobacco companies also argue that the nine proposed images extend beyond providing factual information and serve as an anti-smoking advocacy platform. The statute gives the FDA the power to regulate the sale and distribution of tobacco products, as well as the ability to require new warning labels, prohibit certain marketing tactics and reduce nicotine levels. The government says the picture requirements are factual and are necessary to warn consumers about the risks of smoking and will discourage people from starting the habit and encourage smokers to quit. Continue Reading Below A federal appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday and is considering the constitutionality of the governments requirement that cigarette packs carry graphic warning labels, which include diseased lungs and gums and a cadaver on an autopsy table. A U.S. district judge ruled in favor of the tobacco companies in February, saying the labels were too obtrusive and violated the companies First Amendment free-speech rights. They cant put their thumbs on the scale to manipulate speech to try and force people to act in the way the government thinks is important. Just because people are not acting in the way it wants, the government cannot control what is said about a product.

But who knows maybe Goldberg has racked up huge gambling debts from ignorant wagers like the one tendered to Cole. Professor Cole may be right to dismiss Jonah Goldberg as a dime-a-dozen pundit. But its time to hold media corporations like Tribune responsible for elevating the Goldbergs and their reckless predictions as they strangle newspapers and silence serious journalists like Bob Scheer.

7937,"For four decades, federal courts have held that the law should be interpreted more broadly, ruling again and again that if the policies of governmental agencies, banks or private real estate companies unjustifiably perpetuate segregation, regardless of their intent, they could be found in violation of the Fair Housing Act. This case has as broad of a reach as anything the court has decided in the last 10 years, said Myron Orfield, director of the Institute on Metropolitan Opportunity at the University of Minnesota Law School, because housing segregation is the foundation of racial inequality in the United States. Landlords or lenders who implement policies or practices that disproportionately impact racial minorities can be found in violation of civil rights law if they cannot justify those practices even if no one can show they acted out of racial animus. The Texas case marks the third effort in as many years by the current justices to consider the intent and reach of the housing act. A federal judge did not find intentional discrimination on the part of Texas officials, but held that the outcome unacceptably increased housing segregation and that the housing agency could have taken steps to ensure that affordable housing units were allotted more equally. The Roberts Court is considered by a host of scholars and others to be the most conservative since the 1930s, and so such an outcome would be consistent with its more narrow interpretations of laws governing voting rights and school segregation. The end of disparate impact policies and cases, she argued, would severely hamper advocates ability to go after systemic housing discrimination in a nation where the segregation of black Americans has barely budged in many cities and where it is growing for Latinos. But this court has been determined to have its say on the housing issue and the legal theory that has come to be known as disparate impact. Of course, even under the legal theory of disparate impact, legitimate business practices that can be justified do not violate the law even if they lead to different results among different racial groups. Texas appealed the ruling, raising the stakes when it decided to challenge whether the Fair Housing Act allowed such disparate impact rulings at all. The other two cases were withdrawn",1,1

Sotomayor argued that Fackrell stopped Strieff illegally as part of a drug investigation, knowing that the odds were decent that his target would have an outstanding warrant for something. She cited statistics showing law enforcements frequent use of warrants to stop all sorts of people for no good reason, writing, Surely we would not allow officers to warrant-check random joggers, dog walkers, and lemonade vendors just to ensure they pose no threat to anyone else. That was a smart move, as the Utah Supreme Court ultimately ruled in his favor and found that the drug evidence, tainted by the illegal stop, should never have been admitted into court. She reminded her colleagues of the real-world consequences of such good-faith mistakes, as the majority called Fackrells actions, describing the indignities inflicted upon people arrested after these sorts of stops: body cavity searches, handcuffing, public humiliation, and a permanent arrest record, among others. But on Monday, the US Supreme Court, in a 5-3 decision, overturned the Utah high court on the grounds that Fackrells conduct was a mistake, negligent behavior that shouldnt lead to the exclusion of the drug evidence. But the state asked the judge to allow the drug evidence anyway, arguing that the outstanding arrest warrant merited the search. There is no evidence that Officer Fackrells illegal stop reflected flagrantly unlawful police misconduct, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion.

True to form, Washington indicated that importance on April 5 by writing off a billion dollars in Pakistani debt to the US.. That might be a trivial matter if the costs were short-term, but the US commitment to foreign aid has not abated with the passage of decades. Why does the US give billions of dollars to Egypt and Israel to maintain a tenuous cessation of hostilities that isnt rooted in any real resolution? At a recent Americans for Victory Over Terrorism university teach-in, Bill Bennett characteristically said that America has been given special gifts and therefore has the obligation to be the worlds policeman. There should be a moratorium on the sort of foreign aid provided to Pakistan and Israel until the US is again financially solvent. In the current budget crisis, foreign aid seems like it would be one of the first things to be scuttled, but Washington disagrees with such parochial logic. To give an example, Israel receives about a third of current US foreign-aid. The dubious logic in which the US commitment to foreign aid is rooted is rivaled in scope by the questionable economics of such programs.

You can also dodge the penalty if you would qualify for Medicaid but live in a state that didnt expand its Medicaid program. For example, you may be exempt from paying a fee if the lowest-priced health plan youre eligible for would cost more than 8 percent of your 2015 income.

Weve already seen these firms harvesting the driver side of the market: Both companies have lured drivers with promises of unrealistically high paydays, then unilaterally changed terms raising commissions, cutting fares, forcing drivers to participate in lower-paying ridesharing services after drivers already made major investments such as buying new cars. Even those who said they might have taken a regular taxi might still be less green than they believe; taxicabs in San Francisco, after all, have to meet tight emissions standards, but Lyft drivers can use any vehicle even a Hummer made after 2000. Maybe you think the traffic and environmental costs are worth it, given the value to consumers of cheap, reliable rides, especially in cities where public transit and taxi services are undependable.

Commissioners said little before voting 4-0 in favor of an amendment to exempt the Lovelace Research Institute from the animal welfare ordinance. The intent of the ordinance was to reduce the number of abandoned rabbits that end up at shelters, said Matthew Pepper, director of the countys Animal Care Services. The ordinance also bans the practice of tethering dogs unless the owner obtains a waiver from Bernalillo County Animal Care Services. Lovelace Institute officials have said they needed the exemption to remain in business in Bernalillo County. CEO Robert Rubin last week asked commissioners to include the exemption to protect animal research at the private nonprofit research organization. ADVERTISEMENT Much of the commissions discussion Tuesday focused on a section of the ordinance that would have banned the sale of rabbits in pet and livestock stores. The ownership transfer would make the institute better able to compete for research contracts, Rubin said. Commissioners borrowed language from a New Mexico law that exempts federally licensed research laboratories from the states animal cruelty law. Then the facility would no longer be part of the base and instead would be in an unincorporated area of Bernalillo County.

The presidents spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that Putin considers it inadvisable to resume airstrikes on Aleppo, and wants to have humanitarian corridors out of Aleppos rebel-held districts stay open both for rebels and civilians to leave the city. Fighting for Aleppo appeared to have calmed by the afternoon after rebels assaulted the citys government-controlled western side with three vehicle bombs and at least 150 rockets in the morning. Rebels said they seized a factory and pushed into government-held neighborhoods in southwestern Aleppo, but the Syrian military said through SANA that it had repelled the offensive from all fronts, with support from allied militias. The area has been subjected to a ferocious campaign of aerial attacks by Russian and Syrian government warplanes, and hundreds of people have been killed in recent weeks, according to opposition activists and trapped residents. Rebels opened a corridor to the east for the month of August after pro-government forces first applied a blockade in July, but they were not able to hold it as the government and its Russian ally pounded the gap with artillery and airstrikes.

13213,"ADVERTISEMENT About this time, China took over as the new economic star in Asia, a role it still occupies today as the worlds second-largest economy behind the U.S. As with Japan, China often is looked upon as a threat to U.S. economic interests. In the 1980s, many politicians and American citizens were anxious because Japan seemed to be beating the U.S. in producing consumer and manufactured goods at every turn. Given the fact that U.S.-China friction has increased during the past few years due to territorial disputes in Asia and Chinas inclination to flex its muscles throughout the world, does the U.S. feel more comfortable with Japan reassuming its place as the number one holder of U.S. debt? In times of uncertainty in the world economy, putting money into U.S. government-backed securities is a popular method to hedge against risk while earning interest on your investment. However, this situation changed in the final quarter of 2016 as Japan was reported as holding $1.13 trillion of U.S. securities compared to Chinas $1.12 trillion, making Japan again the largest holder of U.S. debt. Many U.S. officials accused Japan of not playing fair when it came to trade and viewed it as flooding the U.S. market with its products, while severely restricting its own market to American-made products. Based on President-elect Donald Trumps tweets on Chinas maritime disputes with the U.S., and his threat to slap tariffs on Chinese-made goods, the U.S. relationship with China appears be continuing on the path of contentiousness going forward. This certainly is the case now, but an interesting situation is brewing within China that is driving down that countrys holdings of U.S. securities. A depreciated yuan is not necessarily a bad thing for China as it makes Chinese exports cheaper in countries such as the U.S. Therefore, it is selling liquid assets, in this case U.S. securities, to prop up the yuan on world markets. And, like Japan, China eventually became the number one holder of U.S.",0,0

Remember, the last time Gilead made a big acquisition it acquired Pharmasset's leading asset, which spawned its HCV line of drugs.

The idea is always to keep investing in whats going to make the business successful when you come out of the recession, he said. His best advice is to concentrate on whats really important for the business: That means putting the dollars required behind the brands you believe in most, while still innovating, being creative, satisfying the customer and keeping costs as low as possible.

A major reason behind Amazon's new plan to build a second headquarters elsewhere in North America is the need to hire thousands more software developers. Amazon also says its relocation to downtown Seattle, starting in 2010, has generated $38 billion in additional investments in the city. Cities and states, including Philadelphia and Minnesota, are already raising their hands to propose a site for Amazon's new headquarters. Real-estate and site-selection experts think metropolitan areas like Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and Minneapolis might have the best chances based on the criteria Amazon has laid out.

Healthcare expenses alone keep many people on the job until they are eligible for Medicare at 65, even with substantial retirement savings. First, home equity is an important source of income for many retirees, particularly later in life when other assets may be depleted. Anyone considering retiring before they are eligible for Medicare, or some other health insurance for retirees (such as union benefits) would probably best served to plan for higher healthcare costs in coming years. For many early retirees, this means going without later in life, or relying on family and charity to make ends meet. But many retirees leave a decades-long career and lose the sense of purpose and fulfillment work often provides. According to the department of Health and Human Services, 70% of people who live to age 65 will require long-term care at some point, and insurance or Medicare won't cover many of those costs. Second is the burden of housing costs.Many homeowners enter retirement without a mortgage or pay it off early in retirement. Just as with retirement savings, the data isn't necessarily great when it comes to housing for many older Americans.

Discovery has a tendency to cast doubt on traditional readings, that is the case with the recent discovery of a tower of human skulls in Mexico City that has cast doubt on traditional readings of Aztec history. The tower is believed to be part of the Huey Tzompantli, a rack of bones which became the stuff of legend among Spanish conquistadores as they colonized Mexico. The tower is located close to the Templo Mayor, one of the main Aztec temples in their capital Tenochtitlan, which developed into Mexico City. It's believed that the skulls belonged to male warriors killed in inter-tribal combat before the arrival of the Spanish.

If you consider that the Chipotle drop really reflects a one-time anomaly, overall scores for limited-service restaurants were even more impressive than they appear at first glance.

Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on the Senate floor Friday. It is ABP#160;units like this that#160;stand to benefit from an influx of the 2,000 to 4,000 additional military trainers from the United States and its NATO partners, that Mullens appearing before the#160;Senate Armed Services Committee said#160;would be needed to ""jump-start"" the expansion of#160;the#160;Afghan security forces. The readiness of Afghan security force was thrown in the spotlight over the weekend, before Mullen took to the Senate floor, with U.S. lawmakers urging training to be expedited as an alternative to surging additional American troops. Theyve developed a rapport with locals, who are now starting to inform them of buried bombs, he said.#160; Marines can train them without them having any resources, as long as theyre willing to train, Duffy said. Responding to Levin, Mullen acknowledged the importance of the training effort but said that such a mission could not quickly provide the level of security required by a new counterinsurgency strategy focused on protecting the population and preventing the Taliban from destabilizing the country. Steve Woods, a civilian law enforcement advisor working with Afghan police units in the region, echoed the sentiment: How long would you work if you werent getting paid? In a region where homemade explosives are increasingly used to target both Afghan and NATO security forces, the equipment issue carries over to foot patrols and convoys as well, with ABP troops typically resisting to take the lead, Duffy explained. ""It is not a strategy, but rather an effort to avoid a commitment of more U.S. troops and resources by rushing the development of Afghan forces as a substitute that can somehow solve all of the complex problems",0,2

DePaulis ruling said Mendoza was undoubtedly a public figure who has sought and achieved public prominence, and the Supreme Courts sole statement on the issue was that such a person cannot file a civil suit seeking damages for false light invasion of privacy. He said after post-trial review and briefing that he realized he had mistakenly ruled that New Mexico recognizes the false light invasion of privacy cause of action. A newspaper and publisher cannot call an 80-year-old mayor a gang rapist when they know there was no conviction or trial, Mendozas attorney, Sam Bregman, told jurors in closing arguments in the July trial. George McFall, who defended Zollinger and the newspaper, told jurors they could punish the newspaper only if they believed Mendoza had proven he had no involvement in the attack and was innocent of the gang rapist label. The trend nationwide is to recognize this claim, Loman said, acknowledging there is not a New Mexico case on the point. ADVERTISEMENT DePaulis ruling reversed his earlier decision, made at the beginning of a trial in the lawsuit Mendoza filed against longtime nemesis Zollinger. The First Amendment, the defense said, protects opinions regarding the fitness of a person for public office based on past actions or based on his performance of duties. The defense argued for dismissal, saying the objectionable terminology was made in the context of public discussion and analysis of local politics and that it was published on the opinion page.

In another room, Drew Daniel, one half of experimental duo Matmos, is trying to transmit the concept of his forthcoming album to the subject using only his mind. The next album, he says, just deadpan enough to make matters ambiguous, is going to be all about washing machines. While many of those claims were eventually debunked, plenty of respected scholars bought into them over the course of the 20th centuryUpton Sinclair, for example, the muckraking writer who exposed horrific conditions in the meatpacking industry, conducted his own series of ESP experiments with his wife, and published his findings in 1930. Daniel explains that instead of trying to prove or disprove ESP theory, Matmos hijacked the experiments on behalf of music. I kind of want to resuscitate modern art for regular people, Schmidt says. For the past four years, Daniel has been conducting this ritual with friends and strangers using Ganzfeld, a method of ESP experimentation first conceived in the 1930s. Daniel, meanwhile, doesnt want to make any hard and fast statements about paranormal phenomena. Schmidt estimates that theyve done at least 50 of these sessions across a variety of university campuses, and even at the home the couple shares. Since then, theyve gone on to produce some of the most uncomfortable and catchy performance art ever attempted. This time, instead of mining every day sounds of the physical world, Schmidt and Daniel mined a sampling of the collective unconscious. He even admits that he didnt score highly on psychic-ability tests he undertook before conducting his musical experiment.",1,1

Yet the left continues to push the absurd proposition that the campaign against Constitutional values like free speech makes Americans freer. In order to understand the injustices against Black folks in United States, we must look back to its foundation. Of course, it isnt a safe and welcoming environment for anyone who disagrees, as those who disagree have found out at University of Missouri, from white allies banned from black only safe spaces to preachers being punched in free speech zones. Never mind that the Mizzou protesters forced the campus police to call for reporting anyone who said anything hateful.

Todays decision affirms the right to ask the courts to ensure that the U.S. government complies with this law. U.S. government attorneys argued that American courts shouldnt be the place to decide U.S. military construction in other countries. The U.S. government must realize that the Okinawa dugong is a treasure for Okinawa and for the world. Back in March, when attorneys argued the case in appellate court, Department of Justice attorney Mark Haag said the court is not well-equipped to determine what is in the public interest when the government of Japan is deciding whats in its interest for a project on its sovereign territory, and which it is paying for itself pursuant to a treaty. The lawsuit had been dismissed in 2015 by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco. But Mondays had been dismissed by a lower court, but the 9th Circuit overruled that decision and will send the lawsuit back to Chen to move forward. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled that the Center for Biological Diversity, Earthjustice, as well as Japanese environmental groups and activists, have the legal right to pursue its lawsuit against the Defense Department to require it to consider the threats to the dugong.

We discussed these reports on Rick Smith's radio show about that afternoon, shortly before new reports surfaced which suggested the deal may not close anytime soon. Another 750,000 would supposedly receive $1,800 each, an insulting figure for wrongful foreclosure. The banks would be able to choose which mortgages to write down, which means they'll almost certainly pick mortgages they bundled and sold - often deceptively - to investors that include pension funds. The specifics weren't available, but the agreement appeared to settle a number of potential civil and criminal charges for an amount that ranges between $19 billion and $25 billion. Then later yesterday afternoon the office of Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, who is leading the investigations, announced that there is no deal and it may not be completed this week.

9330,"The latest test scores measuring whether or not students are meeting state standards showed Santa Fe Public Schools still lagging behind state averages, with fewer than half of students overall rated as proficient or better in reading and math. Overall, this years Santa Fe scores show students proficiency highest in the lower grades, continually dropping until the third year in high school, when they suddenly shoot up again. The Santa Fe scores also show students overall doing better at reading than math, although the gap among females is greater than for males. SFPS also touted improvements in scores by children still learning the English language, with 20.2 percent registering proficient levels in reading and 15.8 percent in math. Students in 11th grade showed the greatest improvement, with 53.3 percent of students scoring at proficient levels in reading, an increase of 13.5 percent over the previous year, and 32.4 percent scoring proficiency in math, an increase of 5.1 percent. The preliminary data, released Friday, showed 46.1 percent of SFPS students were rated proficient in their grade level for reading and 35.1 percent for math; statewide, the figures were 51 percent for reading and 42 percent for math. Such indicators, according to the news release, include improvements in math scores in 56 percent of SFPS schools and in reading for 44 percent of schools. Statewide, high schools students improved their reading scores, but elementary students in grades 4-6 fell back, according to Gov. An achievement gap also clearly exists between Anglos and Hispanics, with students identified as Caucasian getting higher scores in all subject areas. These 2013 Standards Based Assessment scores reflect tests taken by 8,411 students in grades 3-8 and 10-11 in Santa Fe Public Schools. At least initially, Boyd told the Journal he couldnt say whether the scores reflected greater learning, a particularly smart cohort of students, or the effect of less accomplished students dropping out between the 10th and 11th grades. Proficiency scores for students with disabilities were often in the single digits, while scores were also below averages for students who were economically disadvantaged.",0,0

John McCluskeys attorneys made the announcement after federal prosecutors finished questioning their last witness, bringing an abrupt end to more than four weeks of testimony. They implied Provinces memory might have been clouded by his drug use, while they accused Welch of lying under oath about her efforts to smuggle drugs into the Arizona prison where McCluskey was serving the first year of a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder. Prosecutors had also called to the stand two key witnesses: McCluskeys cousin and girlfriend, Casslyn Welch, and his former prison bunkmate, Tracy Province. Welch told jurors last week that McCluskey allegedly told her he shot the couple because they lied to him about having guns inside the trailer. ADVERTISEMENT After presenting a parade of forensic experts and law enforcement agents, along with dozens of crime scene photos and recorded conversations, prosecutors wrapped up their case Wednesday with testimony from Marcus McCaskill, one of the federal agents involved in the multistate investigation. Defense attorneys spent hours trying to discredit various details of the accounts given by Welch and Province. According to testimony, the trio targeted the Haases for their truck and well-appointed travel trailer after having fled through three states in a cramped car without air conditioning. Both admitted their roles in carjacking the couple and disposing of their bodies, but they testified it was McCluskey who pulled the trigger.

Economists are looking for a similar pattern this year, forecasting second quarter growth of around 2 percent. Forecasters are projecting the first quarter weakness will be followed by a rebound in the current April-June quarter although they are not expecting as big a bounce back as some years in part because of the headwinds currently facing the economy. The higher deficit subtracted 0.3 percentage point from growth in the first quarter. GDP growth has averaged a paltry 0.8 percent in the first quarter over the past six years while second quarter growth has averaged 3.1 percent, nearly four times faster. For the first quarter, consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, grew at a 1.9 percent rate. The first quarter slowdown followed by a second quarter rebound has become a regular feature of this economic expansion, which began in June 2009. Adding to the weakness, the rise in the value of the dollar over the past year hurt exports and drove up the trade deficit. ADVERTISEMENT Since this recovery began almost seven years ago, GDP has been weak in the first quarter each year only to rebound in the spring. Business investment dropped at a 5.9 percent rate, the biggest quarterly plunge since the depths of the recession in 2009.

5937,"According to Weiss, the presidents view on condom use isnt the only troubling aspect of his AIDS policy: Bush has appointed to key scientific advisory committees numerous people with political, rather than scientific, credentials. Bushs new global AIDS law requires research into condom use in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce deaths from cervical cancer, according to the Cancer Institute. While many of the scrutinized policies are environmental, Bushs zest for bastardizing scientific findings has allegedly bubbled over into other political issues, overflowing into the manipulation of research funding, influencing committees on issues from missile defense to reproductive health, from substance abuse to prescription drugs. Waxmans committee, now under fire by the administration as pushing a partisan agenda, hypothesizes that the misuse and manipulation of science is part of a deliberate ploy to keep Bushs industrial and religious cronies safe from governmental regulation. But critics of the healthy forest plan charge that the President is manipulating science to benefit the timber industry and gut bedrock environmental laws, as Gary Kozel of the Wilderness Society put it. Banner, according to the Waxman report, testified in 2002 that childrens brains could be exposed to seven times the current limits (the limit in question when Weitzman was released). The introduction to the Reform Committees 40 page report describes the trangressions and their common link: The Administrations political interference with science has led to misleading statements by the President, inaccurate responses to Congress, altered web sites, suppressed agency reports, erroneous international communications, and the gagging of scientists. And Bushs abstinence agenda has even called condom use into question by making hay of the fact that condom use does not prevent all sexually transmitted diseases. Most jarring, however, are the reports description of Bushs appointments to (and removals from) committees meant to provide unbiased scientific oversight. And just as the federal Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning and Prevention was discussing the possible lowering of lead exposure limits, Bush dismissed three panelists, replacing them with individuals with ties to the lead industry.",1,1

The hard questions involve how, exactly, the left conceives of political change and what we are willing to do to bring it about. Black Lives Matter activists have recognized this crucial fact.The Sanders campaign is forcing a split in the Democratic Party. The political question this poses for the left is whether we want to join the battle tearing apart the Democratic Party. Their push and pull against one another accounts for much of what many dislike about politics: banal rhetoric, betrayals, splits. And for those convinced that only a politics that develops outside the system can change the system, its unclear how the campaign is anything but another iteration of the society of the spectacle: enthusiasm is mobilized and directed until redirected onto the next new thing. Such an invocation leaves out the institutions through which movement power becomes political change, the sites where the meaning of the movement is fought over and advanced. Since Bill Clintons co-creation and occupation of the Democratic Leadership Council in the 1980s, the Democratic Party has shifted ever rightward, jettisoning any commitment to the working class it might once have had, courting the finance sector and other elements of the corporate elite, and adorning itself with just enough cultural politics to placate its base. When we occupy the party, we continue the movement, pushing the power of the people. One way is to occupy institutions that have the capacity to realize movement aims. Too often left voices invoke social movements as independent of political organization, as if the momentary presence of crowds in the street translated automatically into power that endures.

By adhering to this belief, more accurately an illusion, they avoid facing the fact that the fundamental principles that actually operate in state-craft, namely, ruthless, rational calculation in the advancement of U.S. economic and political interests, are contrary to Christian principles used to organize the first Christian communities, namely sacrificial love, compassion, forgiveness, and distribution of resources according to needs. If we work to get rid of or limit this illusion, people of other religious and secular faiths may feel more at home in the U.S. Perhaps another benefit would be a growing awareness of the misdeeds done under the name of Christian nation. As for the second question, one need only go down the depressively long list of cruel, destructive, exploitive, and oppressive actions perpetrated in the name of a Christian nation to see that it has not been an inducement to live a more moral life, though people like Martin Luther King Jr. and others used this to prick the consciences of white Americans. One might be tempted to call the belief that the U.S. is a Christian nation a myth, the seeds of which were sown in 1630 when John Winthrop challenged his community to establish a city on the hill, reflecting the covenant of God and Christian charity. This was also true after the War of Independence and in this sense one might say this was a Christian nation in that most of the settlers called themselves Christian. Even if people recognize that one can be American and from other faith traditions, patriotic Christians identity is wedded to national identity. I will come back to this, but for now let me say that this new Christian nation was clearly neither a Christian theocracy not a parliamentary system advocating a particular religion. The first is the view that sheer numbers of people who believe in Christ indicates we are a Christian nation, but this fails because of the",1,1
11223,"The latest sheriff to take a constitutional stand is Eddy County, New Mexicos Scott London, the first sheriff in twenty-five to stand up to the IRS against a tyrannical attempt to sell a citizen in his countys land without due process. Under the law, Carter claims that the IRS can take no more than 15% of his Social Security benefits, but theyve not only taken 100% of them, theyve even deprived him of $2800.00 via his bank account. Sheriff London told Mr. Rutherford that he had better present proof of that before he will ever consider allowing the sales to take place. Perhaps it is not only Sheriff London that needs to take a physical stand at the properties of Mr. Carter, but also the people of New Mexico, just as Americans did for Cliven Bundy and his ranch. But Sheriff London is the first one to stand up to the IRS since the early 1990s. Thus I am notifying you that under compulsion to my oath to the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the State of New Mexico, I shall not allow the sales of these three properties on 19 February 2015, he wrote. Yet, the IRS under the auspices of Judge Brack and the US District court, are attempting to deprive Mr. Carter of his property with full knowledge that Mr. Carters right to due process is still engaged. One court document, according to Jones indicates that Carter owed $145,000, which Carter maintains has no basis and was pulled out of thin air by an assessing agent. KrisAnne Hall documents why sheriffs like London are so important to the people in her excellent article on what is taking place in New Mexico.

Some were official U.S. adversaries, like Iran and Syria, brought together with the CIA by the shared interest of combating terrorism. But the Open Society Foundation's study into renditions comes right as Obama aide John Brennan - already under pressure to clarify his role, if any, in post-9/11 torture - is about to testify to the panel ahead of becoming CIA director. ""Because the hand-over happened soon after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan,"" Singh writes, ""Iran was aware that the United States would have effective control over any detainees handed over to Afghan authorities."" Singh and the Open Society Foundation don't presume that the CIA is out of the extraordinary renditions game under Obama. It remains to be seen if the Senate committee will ask Brennan to clarify if the CIA still practices extraordinary rendition, along with its old friends. Only it's never been clear just how many nations enabled CIA capture and torture; cooperated with it; or carried it out on behalf of the U.S. Until now.

""You have a chance to at least explore and engage to see if there is a fit,"" said Alan Mitrani, managing partner of the hedge fund Sylvan Lake Asset Management in Northern New Jersey, which he said was a long-term investor in Rockwell. Emerson is pushing ahead with the bid because it believes that putting the companies together would create a new powerhouse in the production of equipment and software used to control automated manufacturing processes, a $200 billion global market.

7312,"The plant operator of Japan's damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant has admitted that it may have been leaking radioactive water since April this year. More than 18,000 people were killed in the catastrophe, and the damage the disaster brought to the Fukushima plant was also the worst of its kind since the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986. Tokyo Electric Power (Tepco), the firm behind Fukushima's operations said there were errors on the settings of six indicators responsible for the monitoring of groundwater levels of wells around reactor buildings 1-4 located at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear power station. The case which was handed a ruling last week examined whether the Japanese government and Tepco could have foreseen the tsunami, and better prepare for the would-be disaster. Cooling water has been leaking from the damaged reactors of the plant and it's also mixing with groundwater pooling in the basements of the reactor building, thus increasing the total amount of contaminated water. The probable explanation to such is that sometime in May, groundwater at one of the wells sank below the contaminated water inside, which may have then caused the radiocactive water to leak into the soil. Fukushima Feared Potentially Leaking Radioactive Water the Past 5 Months. The class suit argued that the disaster could have been prevented as emergency generators could have been positioned at a location higher than the plant, which stands 10 meters above sea level. Wells around the reactor are meant and designed to pump groundwater away from the basements and to reduce the amount around the reactor area. Tepco was also ordered by a court last week to pay $3.36 million to 42 plaintiffs for the nuclear disaster. A 2002 government earthquake assessment made public predicted a 20 percent chance of a magnitude 8 earthquake affecting the area within 30 years.

14319,"Prada 4Q Profit Rises to Record on Strong Asia Growth.Italian fashion house Prada SpA on Friday reported a record quarterly profit that beat analysts' estimates, as strong sales of its main product line in Asia helped offset weaker spending in Europe. Advertisement The greater China region which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau - generated net sales of 735.6 million euros, up 35% from 2011, the company said. Milan-based Prada is seen as a proxy for the booming luxury goods market in Asia, especially in Greater China. Overall revenue climbed 29% to 3.3 billion euros in 2012, led by the Asia-Pacific region, which accounted for 35.6% of group sales versus 34.6% in 2011. The maker of luxury bags and Miu Miu-brand dresses posted a net profit of 217.1 million euros ($279 million) for its fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, up from 158.8 million euros a year earlier. For 2012, total net profit came to 625.7 million euros ($804 million), up 45% from 431.9 million euros in the prior year, and compared with analysts' expectations of 639 million euros, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Prada says it still has ample room for growth in emerging markets where it has a smaller presence compared with rivals like LVMH and Salvatore Ferragamo. Milan-based Prada, which competes with LVMH's Louis Vuitton and PPR's Gucci, has been strengthening its position in the Asian luxury market, particularly in Greater China. Sales in Europe have continued to grow but at a weaker clip than in Asia. A crackdown on corruption and ostentatious spending in China from the second half of 2012 has dampened sentiment for conspicuous brand names. The Hong Kong-listed company is also expanding in markets such as the Middle East and the Americas.

ACLU defends student’s right to read Bible.By Bob Allen The American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee is speaking up for an elementary school student reportedly told he could not read the Bible during an after-school program funded by taxpayers. The ACLU opposes legislation recently passed by the Tennessee state senate to ensure students can express their religious views at school. The letter was on behalf of a boy reportedly told by staff of the program that operates sites in several county schools funded primarily by state and federal grants that he could read any book except the Bible and that he would have to put the Bible away.

The First Amendment exists to protect religious freedom, Thomas Castelli, ACLU-Tennessee legal director, said in a press release. An action alert said the Religious Viewpoints Antidiscrimination Act crosses the line from protecting religious freedom into creating systematic imposition of some students personal religious viewpoints on other students. Hedy Weinberg, executive director of Tennessee ACLU, said the goal of the letter was to clarify what seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Constitution protects religious liberty. While this means that schools may not impose or promote religion, it also means that students can engage in religious activities that they initiate, provided they do not cause a disruption or interfere with the education of other students. When he refused, staff reportedly tried to take his Bible from him, claiming the state could shut the program down if they allowed him to read it.

11053,"But defense and military officials involved in sexual assault response and reporting now say the questions may have inadvertently included innocent actions by commanders seeking to protect the victim or other social practices that were not designed to persuade a victim not to press forward with criminal proceedings. At the same time, military leaders are expanding efforts to better train their lower- and midlevel commanders to detect and deal with retaliation, while also insuring that other, more innocent actions are not misinterpreted by assault victims. Pentagon leaders said the survey questions need to reflect what legally constitutes retaliation, which includes taking action to discourage someone from going forward with an assault complaint. Sexual assault is such a heinous crime, Snow said, that a victim may easily interpret any action by a superior - even a transfer to give the victim time to heal - as a reprisal. ADVERTISEMENT The survey showed that unwanted sexual contact against men usually involves multiple assailants on more than one occasion, happens during work hours at their duty station and is more often described by the victim as hazing or an effort to humiliate them. They said commanders need to find ways to detect those problems and stop them, either by taking action against perpetrators or making it known throughout the unit that social ostracism is not acceptable, and by communicating better with victims. Snow and Galbreath said the military must understand what exactly that is, and whether they can determine if the social reaction is designed to deter a victim from pursuing legal action - which would more clearly be retaliation. Often a lower-level commander may not be aware of a sexual assault case, and could inadvertently discipline someone for failing to show up for duty, when they may have been seeking health care or other assistance. But they also acknowledged that often victims believe they are being retaliated against if peers no longer invite them to parties or if they are disciplined for illegal drug or alcohol use in connection with the assault. Last December, the RAND survey estimated that 62 percent of sexual assault victims believed they faced some type of professional retaliation, social ostracism, adverse administrative action or punishment",0,0

Although it may have seemed that Blake was Twelves protector, rescuing him from a government concentration camp, the truth is that Twelve, as he was for so many wild horses, was probably Blakes protector, a constant in a life that itself underwent so much turmoil. Blakes latest book, Twelve: The King, is a moving story of his love for wild horses, especially one, a black gelding with the number 1210 branded onto his left flank. And so he paid $120 to adopt the unadoptable horse, one who wouldnt associate with Blakes domestic horses yet watch over them and be their protector. Apparently, the remaining 20,000 horses were taking up too much space and resources from the four million head of cattle. Twelve is the story of that love, that companionship, the story of a writer and a horse, each of whom values not just the spirit of independence but also the land and all that live upon it.

These are people whove killed children, killed Muslims, take sex slaves, theres no religious rationale that would justify in any way any of the things that they do, he said. There is no doubt, and Ive said repeatedly, where we see terrorist organizations like al Qaeda or ISIL They have perverted and distorted and tried to claim the mantle of Islam for an excuse for basically barbarism and death, he said. Translation: Islamic terrorism, in Obamas worldview, doesnt exist. Do you still believe that the acts of terrorism are done for the self-proclaimed Islamic religious motive? But what I have been careful about when I describe these issues is to make sure that we do not lump these murderers into the billion Muslims that exist around the world, including in this country, who are peaceful, who are responsible, who, in this country, are fellow troops and police officers and fire fighters and teachers and neighbors and friends. Its why, eight years after President Obama took office, jihad in America is now weekly, sometimes daily, and the order of the world has been overturned by the global jihad war. Obama will not say Islamic terrorism because he is a true believer and will not violate the speech laws (blasphemy) under Islamic law (sharia). Its why, upon becoming President, he purged all intel and law enforcement counter terror material of Islam and jihad.",1,3

According to Swaity, children of divorce ""are affected by it forever"": In fact, Judy Wallerstein, a well-known advocate of children of divorce, stated that even 25 years later, children of divorce were 40% less likely to marry. 7 Reasons You Should Stay Married Rather Than Getting Divorced.A new study shows that the vast majority of married couples that stay together even when there is unhappiness end up being happy that they didn't divorce. Freelance writer Sharilee Swaity points out that ""divorce is the ultimate rejection"" since it means that one failed at maintaining a relationship with what they thought was their life partner. Children of divorced parents are often caught in the middle, as they have to divide their timeand emotionsbetween both parents and possibly even have to move to accommodate a divorce. According to the Telegraph, the divorce process can only take a few weeks if there are no disagreements, but since that's unlikely divorce proceedings typically take at least a year to occur. This is not to say there aren't valid reasons to have a divorce; abusive marriages, affairs or the realization that it just isn't meant to be are certainly acceptable reasons for a divorce. The study, conducted by the Marriage Foundation, found that of the 70 percent of couples remain married despite such problems following the birth of their first child. The Huffington Post notes that the average divorce costs somewhere in the $15,000 to $20,000 range, as the following costs have to be taken care of: And if there is real estate involved, you can also expect to pay: Between the aforementioned costs and the cost of child support, divorce can result in a lot of money being lost.

4208,"(Last year's) House bill was inadequate in that it focused almost exclusively on border security and failed to position the government to deal realistically with the immigration crisis in a way that would restore trust among the citizenry,' Land continued, quoting language from a resolution on immigration reform that messengers to the 2006 SBC annual meeting passed. With the House's new Democratic leaders more amenable to broader immigration reform, immigrant advocates are hoping a compromise bill can pass both chambers and gain President Bush's signature. Bush broke with many immigration hard-liners in his own party last year by signaling White House support for aspects of reform sought by advocates for the millions of undocumented laborers already working in the United States. Even though the solutions proposed in the House and Senate legislation are not the same, at least the House and Senate bills are talking about the same issues, she said. Suzii Paynter, director of the Baptist General Convention of Texas Christian Life Commission, believes the bills proposed in the House provide hope immigration reform can happen. A spokesperson in his Senate office said she couldn't give details of what he would propose this time around because Kennedy and his colleagues still were hammering out details. However, the Republican leaders then in charge of the House pushed through a competing measure that took a hard line on immigration. For example, he noted, like the STRIVE Act, it would assess a penalty for workers who have been breaking the law by living and working in the United States illegally. However, Land appeared at a March 29 Capitol Hill press conference with Kennedy, the sponsors of the STRIVE Act and Latino Christian leaders to push for reform. The legislation proposed in the House is closer to what the Senate proposed last year, she said. The Catholic bishops' conference's Appleby said the STRIVE Act has some enforcement provisions that give us some heartburnsuch as passport-fraud provisions that he said could hurt asylum-seekers from troubled countries.

Word of Trumps planned announcement, which would deviate from previous U.S. presidents who have insisted the Jerusalems status must be decided in negotiations, drew criticism from the Palestinian Authority and was sure to anger the broader Arab world. Jordan begins diplomatic offensive ahead of Trump move on Jerusalem.AMMAN (Reuters) Jordan has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) before an expected move this week by U.S. President Donald Trump to recognize Jerusalem as Israels capital, a senior Jordanian source said. Jordan, the current president of the Arab summit, would invite members of the two bodies to convene if the recognition is extended, to discuss ways of dealing with the consequences of such a decision that raised alarm and concern, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source told Reuters. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israels claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions. It is essential no unilateral decisions are made that would change the historic status quo of Jerusalem as an occupied city whose fate needs to be determined in final status talks within an overall peace package, the senior Jordanian diplomatic source added. Jordan lost East Jerusalem and the West Bank to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and says the citys fate should only be decided only at the end of a final settlement. Recognizing Jerusalem would upend decades of American policy and possibly inflame tensions in the Middle East. King Abdullahs Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, making Amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city.

As the Kentucky counting went on into the night, Mr. Sanders was preparing to speak to thousands of supporters in California, where Democrats will vote June 7 and a state that the Sanders campaign hopes to secure a major, race-altering victory. While the Clinton campaign surely would have preferred a greater margin of victory, Tuesdays win at least halts Mr. Sanders momentum and gives the former first lady another victory in her column. Mrs. Clintons poll numbers against Mr. Trump have slipped, raising questions about whether shes best suited to beat the billionaire businessman in November. Closed primaries have tended to favor Mrs. Clinton, while Mr. Sanders has benefited from open primaries by pulling significant numbers of independent voters to his side. The Sanders campaign is trying to woo superdelegates to its side ahead of the party convention in July, but there is no evidence that such a strategy will work as long as Mrs. Clinton retains her lead among pledged delegates. Mr. Trump also tweaked Mrs. Clinton, suggesting that the close contest in Kentucky proves she is a bad candidate. Later on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders was projected the winner in Oregons Democratic primary, leading by a much more decisive margin of 53 percent to 47 percent. An NBC News poll released gave Mrs. Clinton a 3-point advantage over Mr. Trump in a hypothetical November matchup, 48 percent to 45 percent.

Failure in Europe to distinguish between legitimate refugees and other types of migrant, says Traub, could send the message to millions or maybe tens of millions of people in dysfunctional countries in Africa and elsewhere that I can leave because Europe and others will have to take me. The world now has more refugees and displaced people than at any time in history: 65 million to be precise.#160;And millions more people are trying to get away from poverty and crime in many parts of Africa and Asia.

Polls that point to a blowout for Merkels Christian Democratic-led bloc will converge back to fundamentals, said Mark Kayser, a professor of applied methods and comparative politics at the Berlin-based Hertie School of Governance. The model offers a more measured electoral picture than voter-intention polls, in which her bloc has vaulted ahead of the second-place Social Democrats after an early surge of support for SPD challenger Martin Schulz faded. ADVERTISEMENT Merkel appears to have largely maintained her support after nearly 12 years of power, withstanding a cost to ruling factor, by which electorates begin to view politicians as having been around too long, he said. The Hertie projection looks at political and economic data, including national and state election distributions going back as far as 1961, rather than poll samples. One surprise yielded by the model was for Germanys Greens, whose support in national polls has slipped into the mid-single digits. A predictive model from YouGov Plc in last weeks U.K. election proved to be more accurate than most polls, pointing to Theresa Mays Conservatives losing 20 seats in a hung Parliament with no party obtaining a majority. An early version of the Hertie model also showed Merkel ahead in February and March, when polls indicated that the SPD had pulled even with the CDU-CSU.

Whether the mayor or the superintendent has the ultimate authority is less important, I believe, than the conditions in which teachers teach and the content of what their students are asked to learn: It is possible, in overcrowded classes, to force-feed students enough regurgitable information and to administer enough practice tests to raise test scores some. The tunnel vision focused on these criteria, however, will continue to produce students who are intellectually inept, virtually illiterate, bored, oblivious to world issues, uninterested in global warming or nuclear proliferation or overpopulation but if they can raise their test scores by a few percentage points, then all will be well.

8522,"HOLLOWING THE FORCE.BY: Adam Kredo July 26, 2012 5:00 am Mandatory cuts to the U.S. defense budget scheduled for the end of the year could cripple Americas armed forces by leaving them ill-equipped, understaffed, and unprepared to carry out missions in an increasingly dangerous world, former military officials and lawmakers warned Wednesday during a briefing on Capitol Hill. ""If you take the Navy back to the size it was [during] World War I and the Air Force back to the size it was when it was created, and 200,000 [troops] from the military, thats the definition of a hollow military,"" McKeon said, using a term describing a fighting force that appears functional on paper but cannot carry out actual missions. While the much-feared defense cuts would hinder the American militarys capabilities, it would also result in inadequate training for future soldiers. Hostile foreign nations such as North Korea and Iran hope that Congress will fail to stop sequestration, so that widespread defense cuts castrate the U.S. military, several lawmakers said. In a worst case#160;scenario, sequestration would shrink the U.S. Army from 560,000 troops to fewer than 490,000; the Marines from 202,000 to fewer than 182,000; the Navy from 325,000 to fewer than 322,000; and the Air Force from 333,000 to fewer than 330,000, according to statistics provided by the Reserve Officers Association (ROA). If Congress fails to prevent the automatic cuts by striking a compromise, nearly 2.1 million jobs could be lost200,000 of which would affect uniformed military personnel, studies show. Inadequate training and Obama administration proposals to cut pay for reserve officers could lead many to opt out, Davis warned. ""North Korea, Iran, the whole Middle East, Chinaweve got challenges all around the world"" and will be unable to compete if further cuts take place, McKeon said.

8458,"This gendered approach has been taken into account with the participation of civil society during the negotiations to bring about the agreement where distinct organizations, leaders, Caribe Afirmativo among them, in February 2015 shared some of the experiences that LGBT people had within the context of the conflict, the contributions they have historically made for peace and the reflections that they have had in a Colombian society that has not accepted diversity for many years. Thus, we at Caribe Afirmativo think that the peace agreement will allow for the construction of a more inclusive Colombia, where not only violence from the internal armed conflict will cease, but state institutional and political guidelines for the recognition of the rights of LGBTI people, promoting spaces of participation where a peace can be constructed from the territories that recognize the rights of all people who are afforded rights will be established. Therefore, the peace agreement that has been reached, after four years of conversations between the government and the FARC-EP, one of the continents oldest guerrilla groups, is an achievement for civil society because it opens the possibility of putting an end to the violence that has encompassed every part of the country and to begin to build a Colombia free of violence. This historic opportunity will also allow civil society to learn the importance and contributions of LGBTI people in the country, removing all of those conceptions that have seen diversity as an obstacle and at the same time it will begin to guarantee a Colombia where people can exercise their full citizenship without any limitation. In this sense, LGBT people are an important component as members of civil society that have been a part of the peace movements, like it was with Planeta Paz at the end of the 90s. But in order to achieve a peace that reaches the whole country and all of its people, you need to remove those stereotypes and prejudices that have allowed marginalization, discrimination and violence against people because of their sexual orientation or gender identity for which armed groups are responsible through their violent actions. All of this is recognized in the deal, where the gendered focus transverses all the points and agreements that have been achieved, recognizing the grave consequences the conflict has had against LGBTI people and the need to achieve a society free of discrimination and with equal rights for everyone.

3578,"The telephone survey found that 75 percent of respondents - including majorities of both supporters and opponents of legal marijuana - think that the sale and use of pot eventually will be legal nationwide. The Pew Research Center survey also shows increased support for ending mandatory minimum prison sentences for nonviolent drug offenders and doing away altogether with jail time for small amounts of marijuana. The survey was about evenly divided in 2001 on whether it was good or bad for states to move away from mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. It marked a turning point in a gap that has been shrinking fairly steadily since 1969, the earliest data available, when 84 percent said pot should be illegal and only 12 percent thought otherwise. Since California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, at least 19 others and the District of Columbia have followed suit, including two that have approved recreational use. The survey indicates that four years ago, 52 percent of respondents said they thought the use of marijuana should not be legal, while 41 percent said it should. Respondents said by a margin greater than 3-to-1 that people who use small amounts of pot shouldn't go to jail. Today, poll respondents favored moving away from such policies by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, or 63 percent to 32 percent. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, critics and political leaders, both liberal and conservative, have clamored for an end to harsh drug sentences, saying mandatory minimums have contributed to prison overcrowding, civil rights violations and strained budgets. The survey also highlighted a dramatic shift in attitudes on drug conviction penalties. The new poll shows a reversal with 54 percent in favor of legalization and 42 percent opposed.

6668,"Its absolutely the sort of fight that Trump would relish, mind you, pitting egghead supporters of free speech and the First Amendment against the patriotism of people who find flag-burning unacceptable. The suggestion that those who burn flags should lose their citizenship is remarkable in part because its such a drastic response one that would itself rescind any number of legal protections to which the culprit would otherwise be entitled. Given the attention he has paid of late to casting his opponents in a negative light (like those claims about voter fraud that were the subject of his tweets Monday), perhaps he wants to force them to defend an unpopular position. If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, Justice William Brennan wrote in response to the decision to strike down the 1989 federal law, it is that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. Theres an operating theory among some that Trump throws out tweets like this to distract attention from something else, as though 140-character messages demand our total (100 percent) brain capacity. Theres a fair argument to be made that, in the absence of any broader debate or proposed policy, this tweet about the flag should be treated as a curiosity. He has railed against the oppositional media repeatedly, suggesting at one point that he might open up libel laws to make it easier to sue the media. One of the justices who supported that 5-4 decision was Antonin Scalia, the jurist whose death earlier this year created the vacancy that it seems Trump will get to fill with someone, he has said, he hopes will be in the mold of Scalia. If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag, he said last year, adding an important disclaimer: But I am not king.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has said it will repair the damage, but that's expected to take some time because of the political instability in the country. The cemetery that was vandalized is home to more than a thousand remains of war dead from the British Commonwealth, which includes soldiers from the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, India and South Africa. The graves were in two cemeteries in the eastern city of Benghazi, the Benghazi War Cemetery and the Benghazi British Military Cemetery. One of the men can be heard saying ""this is a grave of a Christian"" as he rips out a headstone from the ground. According to CTV, at least one of the desecrated graves belongs to a Canadian airman, Flying Officer Martin Palmer Northmore.

It also depicts some lesser-known aspects of the conflict that started as a revolt against the established central government and expanded into a national civil war, such as the U.S. involvement in pitting Mexican leaders against one another. Music also played a prominent role, and Library of Congress researchers include corridos (narrative ballads) and other music popular during that time, as well as rare video footage of a military parade in Mexico City. The materials, many of which are available online for the first time in this exhibit, also examine the U.S. invasion of the Mexican port city of Veracruz in 1914, and the 1916 search and unsuccessful attempt at capturing General Francisco Pancho Villa, led by U.S. Army General John Pershing. The exhibit is divided into seven sections that include a meticulous description of the factors that lead to the 10-year armed struggle which fundamentally changed Mexican culture and its governmental structure. Another video shows soldiers and women leaving Mexico City and is described as the self-sacrificing soldaderas following their brave men.

668,"The jailing of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko sparked criticism from Europe and elsewhere, and resulted in speculation over whether the country might abandon its path toward integration with the European Union and instead cozy up with Vladimir Putin's ""Eurasian Union"" - which would demand less on human rights and democracy. I think that both the Japanese tragedy and Chernobyl disaster taught us something, which is that we must pay more attention to design, construction and other safety aspects. If you look ahead 20 years, would it be more surprising for you to see Ukraine as part of a tightly-knit CIS Union, or to be closer to the European Union? What I mean is that Ukrainian laws were violated in the extremely unfavorable conclusion of the negotiations, which has caused great hardship in the Ukraine. It is extremely beneficial for us because it opens markets for us [and] limits the number of exemptions from free trade, including a phase-out of tariffs on sugar and the right for gas from other countries - including Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan - to come to Ukraine while passing through Russian territory. Today, I saw with my own eyes: it is producing the first stage of parts for the US-designed Stanford Torus space station in collaboration with scientists from the United States. Does this deal mean Ukraine will seek closer relations with the CIS rather than the European Union? Well, let's ask the question in a different way: Is it correct that a government official can act the way Tymoshenko acted? If those who criticize the Ukraine believe she acted correctly, then that changes the argument. We want to defend our national interests, and one of our national interests is to have good relations with all our neighbors.

57,"From Village to CollegeThe moderately liberal character of Egyptian legal education may help explain the Bar Associations relative resistance to Islamism, but it only begins to get at the appeal of Islamism to the rest of Egypts rising generation of educated professionals. And many liberals, even if they oppose the Presidents policies, believe that expanded education and economic development will gradually nudge the worlds peoples toward a liberal governing vision. That election victory was the capstone of a decades-long process whereby the Muslim Brotherhood the worlds first and foremost Islamist organization gained control of Egypts prestigious professional unions. Yet in America, even conservatives are liberal, in the sense that they favor the gradual, world-wide expansion of free markets and democracy. On that day, in free and fair elections, representatives of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood gained control of the Egyptian Bar Association, Egypts last great organized bastion of middle-class secular liberalism. In general, the Islamist groups that came to dominate Egypts college campuses in the 1970s provided students fresh from villages with a sense of community in an otherwise disorienting urban, secular, individualist environment. Precisely because they hoped to create a class that could eventually rule India as a democracy, the British set up a system of English-language education that was liberal in the broadest sense. Unused to living on coeducational campuses and worried about protecting their reputations and keeping themselves marriageable these young women experienced the call of Islamist student organizations to don the veil as a welcome return to familiar ways. So even without a conventional undergraduate liberal education, Egypts attorneys necessarily embody some of that same liberal spirit. Their families had made huge sacrifices to get them to college all in the hopes that the familys star student would one day secure a high-paying professional job, and forge connections useful to the folks back home. Yet few colleges in the Arab world offer an education that is liberal, in any sense.

He came and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, which overlooks the city, and recited to the men of Shechem in beautiful Hebrew an immortal fable, that starts with the words: The trees went forth to anoint a king over them They approached their fellow trees, one after another, and offered them the crown. When he decided to enter the Knesset again, the 3000 members of the willful Likud Central Committee bounced him back almost to square one: No. Apart from the Herut and Liberal parties, which were already united in a joint faction, he added two tiny groups: Tamirs Free Center and the State List, a remnant of Ben-Gurions devotees. A group of old-time Revisionists (members of the most right-wing Zionist movement, the antecedent of the Herut party), built themselves a neighborhood on the edge of Binyamina, south of Haifa, whose veteran inhabitants treated them with contempt. Olmert is now the acting prime minister of the transitional government, and in a few weeks hence, with the establishment of the new coalition, he will become the head of a regular government. One hundred days after Ariel Sharon sank into a coma, the job and the title were taken away from him, as the law demands. This may be what instilled in the boy Ehud the urge to stand out, to attain public recognition and also to get rich. He caused a split between Tamir and his partner, the veteran right-wing politician Eliezer Shostak, left the party and founded another one with Shostak. It might serve the annexation of large areas (without Arabs), or turn out to be a hallucinatory plan that will never be implemented. History has known small politicians who stepped out",1,1

Speaking to more than 250 participants from the public and private space industry, Jah asked, Can we bring to the table some science that would help resolve that problem? Most of these people dont realize the perils of operating in space. Jah noted that with the cost of getting to space getting cheaper, the risk of operating in space is actually increasing.

Trump has recruited Marc Short, who has been serving as a top adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence, to the West Wing, likely as head of legislative affairs, two people with knowledge of the position said Monday night. In the Trump administration, Lighthizer will work closely on trade issues with Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor who is the nominee for commerce secretary, and Peter Navarro, an economist and China hawk who has been tapped to lead a new White House National Trade Council. In the run-up to his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump will be making a flurry of final nominations for his Cabinet as well as filling out the senior positions in his White House. He served as Pences chief of staff during his time in Congress and later worked as president of Freedom Partners, the powerful political network of the billionaire industrialist brothers, Charles and David Koch. Lighthizer has deep roots in the Republican establishment, having served as national treasurer for former Senate majority leader Bob Doles 1996 presidential campaign. A longtime Pence loyalist and confidant, Short joined Trumps 2016 campaign team as an adviser to Pence once the Indianan received the vice-presidential nod. Short and Lighthizer bring to the Trump team years of experience in Washington. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that Lighthizer, long considered a favorite to be trade representative, would become Trumps nominee. Though some in the Pence orbit were initially skeptical of Trump and his team, Short quickly established himself as a conduit between the Pence and Trump worlds and earned the respect of Trump.

Democrats are so fed up with GOP obstruction of Obamas nominees that Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is threatening to change Senate rules on executive branch nominations like Cordrays to allow simple majority of 51 senators to approve nominees instead of the usual 67 needed for to overcome a filibuster. Ever since its inception, Republicans have been doing all they can to kneecap the agency, which they say wield[s] nearly unprecedented powers over Wall Street, as 43 GOP senators wrote in a February letter to the president. Warren and other financial reformers charge that Republicans are trying to block Cordrays confirmation in order to scrap financial reform and rewrite parts of Dodd-Frank that they dont like, as Mike Konczal wrote at the Washington Post in May. Cordrays recess appointment term is up at the end of the year, and Republicans are again vowing to filibuster his re-nomination, unless Democrats allow key changes to the CFPB, such as forcing the agency to be subject to the congressional appropriations process so Congress can revoke its funding, and allowing other regulatory agencies to veto CFPB actions, which Democrats have refused to allow. made a speech on the Senate floor demanding GOP Senators not filibuster a vote on Richard Cordray, Obamas nominee to head the#160; Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

After this past Sundays terrorist attack, I called the family and was relieved to hear that no one was hurt, though they dread having to leave the relative safety of their home to shop for food or other necessities. Candlelight vigils to mourn the dead, a sit-in by members of Congress calling for the passage of gun control legislation, meticulous examinations of the shooters history, family life, religious and political orientations these and other appropriate, necessary responses succeeded in keeping the story alive and bringing into focus the need to understand why these mass murders occur and why they are on the rise in this country. My hope is that others will light candles too and be moved to stand beside you and call in one invincible voice for an end to war in all its forms. There was a time when a Westerner like myself could escort a group of siblings from their home to the shops lining one of Karradas busiest streets.

For this reason, it makes financial sense for companies in the sector to offer big pricing discounts on last-minute deals if the room or the plane has excess capacity. This allows Expedia to have more control on prices and overall supply conditions, but Priceline makes higher profit margins, since it has almost no associated cost of inventory on sales. Consolidation keeps pricing competition in the segment under control, allowing Priceline and Expedia to make attractive profit margins on revenue.

Ortizs sentencing, where he faced three life sentences for the killings and additional time on lesser counts, had been scheduled for Thursday, Jun 29.#160; District Judge Francis Mathew held a hearing with attorneys in the case Wednesday morning, online court records show. A memorandum filed Tuesday by defense attorney Dan Marlowe asked for leniency at sentencing and requests a new trial for Ortiz, based on arguments similar to those Marlowe made in court before Ortizs conviction. Marlowes memo says that because Ortiz was a juvenile when the murders took place, Judge Mathew can grant a waiver from the standard New Mexico life sentence requirements, which allow parole only after 30 years in prison. Marlowe asks that Ortiz be eligible for parole in 10 years, and then also requests that Judge Mathew grant a new trial. He cites a lack of#160; physical evidence like fingerprints or DNA and the conflicting testimony of cousins Ashley and Jose Roybal, the prosecutions main witnesses who were with Ortiz the night of the murders and admitted to conspiring with him in a plan to rob the family of money and marijuana. He was convicted in December of three counts of first-degree murder and other counts in the deaths of 55-year-old Lloyd Ortiz; 53-year-old Dixie Ortiz; and their son, 21-year-old Steven Ortiz, using a mattock, similar to a pickax, in what apparently started as a robbery attempt. The judge wanted us to brief some issues in relation to that, chief deputy district attorney Susan Stinson said Wednesday afternoon, after the sentencing hearings postponement was posted online.

7095,"The recent debate in Washington about whether to let student loan interest rates double ignores the fact that many students already cannot afford a college education or advanced training. We can easily afford the estimated $30 billion annual cost of free college education; a financial-transactions tax would raise many times that sum, and it would inhibit destabilizing speculation on Wall Street. Public interest work is less affordable; as Pam Brown of the Occupy Student Debt Campaign puts it, The debt makes us very individual; we cant afford to help someone else. Now more than half of college graduates under 25 cant find full-time work, and wages for recent graduates are lower than they were in 2000. The United States, once the leader in the percentage of college graduates age 25 to 34, has dropped to sixteenth among thirty-six developed nations, with more and more students dropping out because they cant afford the rising costs. Many students are forced to move back in with their parents after graduation, which depresses the housing market. With a government that shows no interest in making education available to the many, some Americans are taking the initiative themselves. The second effect is ruinous debt: the average indebted college graduate is $25,000 in hock. Students in California have suggested a program that would make a four-year education free for students who maintain at least a 2.7 grade point average or perform 70 hours of community service per year.

6203,"A study last year by the SBC's LifeWay Christian Resources found half of Southern Baptist pastors believe the Holy Spirit gives some people a private prayer language, but those who practice it find themselves increasingly marginalized in convention life. As a well-connected leader in the Southern Baptist Convention in the late 1970s, Phillips would have identified himself as a cessationist a Christian who believes miracles occurred in Bible times but were not valid gifts for today. sAs an officer for eight years with the SBC's North American Mission Board, he also became familiar with countless churches that were declining and dying that he now believes could have been growing in the power of the Holy Spirit. They are committed to historic Baptist identity and doctrine, but make room for the supernatural working of the Holy Spirit within God's people for ministry and proclamation. Instead, he believes the Bible suggests gifts will remain until the Second Coming of Christ. In 2006, Dwight McKissic, a trustee at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, prompted controversy by saying in a chapel service that he also used a private prayer language. Phillips' congregation, which today goes by the name Abba's House, describes itself as a Spirit-filled Southern Baptist church. Could it be that Baptists who believe in the gifts and manifestations of the Spirit are more true to Scripture in their beliefs than some of those who are more comfortable with the formality of the reformation? In 2005, the SBC International Mission Board forbade missionaries to pray in tongues, even though the agency's CEO, Jerry Rankin, has acknowledged using a private prayer language in his own devotional life. Phillips contends Southern Baptists have nothing to fear from those who embrace spiritual gifts but rather should embrace them. He did not receive a private prayer language until three years later, but the moment changed his ministry forever. Phillips wrote in an article for the May 2008 Theology for Ministry, a journal published twice a year by Mid-America Baptist Theological Seminary in Cordova, Tenn.

Humans have basically been the same anatomically for about 100,000 years'so what is safe to say is that if we enjoy it now, then so did our cave-dwelling ancestors and everyone else since, experts say. But just how much has the act really changed through the millennia and even in past decades? ""Just as our bodies tell us what we might like to eat, or when we should go to sleep, they lay down for us our pattern of lust,"" says University of Toronto psychologist Edward Shorter.

NEW YORK Three women who have accused Dustin Hoffman of sexual misconduct say they are still able to watch his movies because they are able to separate the artist from his actions. The 80-year-old initially apologized for making one accuser feel uncomfortable with his comments, but in a testy conversation with comedian John Oliver at public talk earlier this month, he denied any wrongdoing. Rossetter saw Hoffman as her hero when he helped her land her first Broadway play, but things quickly soured when she says he started repeatedly groping her backstage.

If his family, their supporters and then our national media had not latched on to this story, creating the attention that forced Florida to arrest Zimmerman and appoint a special prosecutor a month later, we might never have heard Martin's name, and Zimmerman might still be just an unknown neighborhood watch coordinator riding around Sanford looking for another problem. Much like an armed George Zimmerman riding around to look for a problem in Sanford on the night he shot Trayvon Martin, the Bush administration looked around the Middle East for a problem, decided it had found one in Iraq where nobody had attacked us and where there was no hard evidence that anyone was planning to, and shaped its suspicions into a rationale for invading Baghdad. At no time did I ever hear a policeman tell watch members to drive around alone in their cars at night to patrol their local streets, to follow people who looked suspicious to them for no apparent reason, and then to leave their cars in order to confront a person whom they alone had, without cause, identified as a possible suspect of an uncommitted crime. By then, though, there were way too many questions about whose ground had been violated on the night when Martin died for Zimmerman's lawyers to risk requesting that. But it wasn't until the weekend of March 22, when Cheney got his new heart, that the national news turned our attention to Martin's death, to the circumstances surrounding it, to the lack of an arrest and the immediate ""Stand Your Ground"" claim of innocence, and to the near-immediate release of the man who had, admittedly, ended the boy's life.

The only way for these two viewpoints to be true is to separate the two distinct events transpiring here: 1) the rapture of the Church, which comes before the tribulation; and 2) the return of Jesus to the earth, which takes place roughly seven years later. We believe it is stated time and time again in the bible, in no uncertain terms, and we are proud to take a stand to defend this exciting End Times Bible prophecy. Scripture never mentions that the tribulation is meant to be a time of testing for Christians. Placing the Church dispensation into the same time frame as the seven-year Jewish dispensation, as the post-tribbers do, raises one good question: Can two dispensations transpire at the same time? I think several people would have to question their opposition to the pre-trib rapture doctrine if they knew that the evidence provided to them was based on the understanding that most tribulation prophecies have already occurred.

Despite the fact that the so-called suspicious package discovered on a flight in the United Kingdom tested negative for any explosive material, President Obama, after being informed of the apparent threat yesterday, directed U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies, and the Department of Homeland Security to launch a full-scale security alert, according to a White House press release, which in turn was helpfully elevated to levels of hysteria by the corporate media today. Within hours of this new terror scare breaking every indication, most notably the fact that Obama was informed last night and decided to go ahead with a full security alert despite the UK package being a dud, screams out that this is a contrived political stunt designed to sway the many key undecided voters in anticipation of next weeks mid-terms.

The Washington Post reports that the Eastern District of Virginia's U.S. attorney's office has yet again recommended prosecution for McDonnell to the DOJ, as they believe that they could persuade jurors to convict McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, despite the Supreme Court's ruling. The fact that the DOJ is even considering another prosecution against the McDonnells despite a lack of evidence that they broke the law is yet another example of the DOJ's willingness to put politics above the law, as highlighted by the fact that the DOJ prosecuted conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza but was not willing to prosecute Hillary Clinton over her private email server.

Al-Shami said the defendants conspired and attempted to kill police officers when they broke into three of Egypt's prisons, enabling some 20,000 inmates to flee, causing chaos in Egypt and breaching its borders with the Gaza Strip. Morsi is already serving a 20 year sentence for his part in the killings in 2012 of protesters outside his palace when he was still president. Judge al-Shami also confirmed death sentences for five other jailed leading members of Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, including Mohammed Badie, the group's leader, and Saad el-Katatni, the head of its short-lived political party. The ruling was read out by judge Shaaban al-Shami after he consulted with Egypt's Mufti, a religious authority affiliated with the judiciary, as required by law in cases involving capital punishment. Another 21 imprisoned defendants received life sentences in the case, which in Egypt is equivalent to 25 years in prison.

In 2007 missionaries and their partners also saw the number of overseas churches climb to the highest level in history nearly 182,000, surpassing the 10-million-member mark for the first time. The potential effects of investment losses, a weakened dollar and flattened giving to the Cooperative Program and Lottie Moon Christmas Offering could have a significant impact on the board's work next year. Gordon Fort, vice president of the IMB's office of overseas operations, told trustees these numbers represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of understanding the complete picture of God's work around the world. The dollar also is making a recovery in the world marketplace, gaining as much as 20 percent over some foreign currencies in the past four months. A thrilling aspect of our work over the years has been to see the attitude of our missionaries who started using the expression wigtake,' Rankin told trustees. Though the gain has not yet achieved parity with the dollar's buying power prior to the decline, another 20 percent increase would put the dollar on a one-to-one exchange rate with the euro.

When his company submitted the plan, Trump said he had financial backing from Colony Capital, an investment firm run by his longtime friend Tom Barrack, a California billionaire who is currently serving as one of Trumps economic policy advisers and helping finance a pro-Trump super-PAC. Going back to the bargaining table would not be an extraordinary move for a real estate developerand especially not for Trump, who has frequently sought to change the terms of deals and has bragged of renegotiating debt. But his biggest conflict might be the $200 million hotel project Trumps company is developing a couple of blocks from the White House in the Old Post Office Building, a historic property owned by the federal government and leased to the Trump Organization for 60 years.

Trump, Kushner and Friedman have chosen to partner with the most extreme right-wing forces in Israeli society, and by so doing have in effect put the final nail in the coffin of the two-state solution, an illusion of Palestinian self-governance, which has been central to the American policy in the Middle East. Trump has also stated he would dismantle the Iranian nuclear deal, which has been a crux of contention between the Obama administration and Netanyahu, and has backed his rhetoric with the appointment of cabinet members such as James Mad Dog Mattis, a man hell-bent on antagonizing the Iranian regime. Meanwhile, Trumps radical agenda of supporting the expansion of illegal settlements, annexing parts of the OPT and moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem may serve as a blessing in disguise by finally destroying the last traces of the faade known as the peace process, the two-state illusion and the ethnocratic aberration known as The Jewish state. As such, it is not surprising that evangelical groups comprised a major voting block and source of financial support for the erratic Trump, who recently declared he may renew the nuclear arms race, and for their other favorite politician, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been itching to bomb Iran and possibly kick off World War 3.

The 39-page ACLU statement, which includes many of the President's tweets, says: ""The Trump administration has provided no evidence that this announcement was based on any analysis of the actual cost and disruption allegedly caused by allowing men and women who are transgender to serve openly.

The suit comes after Trump announced the ban in a series of tweets in July and signed a memo to the Pentagon preventing transgender people from enlisting. Trump's move reversed the Obama administration's removal of a trans service member ban the year prior. - News reports indicate the Secretary of Defense and other military officials were surprised by President Trump's announcement, and that his actual motivations were purely political, reflecting a desire to accommodate legislators and advisers who bear animus and moral disproval toward men and women who are transgender, with a goal of gaining votes for a spending bill that included money to build a border wall with Mexico.""

Even critical coverage of appointees like Jeff Sessions might leave some voters with the impression that, however many posts are filled by officials with priorities other than enforcing the laws, individual citizens and mobilized groups can still pursue remedies. Bagenstos suggests another problem linked to an asymmetrical penchant for undermining various pieces of legislation: the longstanding conservative effort to close off the means by which private individuals can guarantee their rights. New presidents bring along thousands of their closest friends to staff a new administration, and Republicans have made it their mission to systematically attack or undermine major federal statutes (like the Voting Rights Act, the Affordable Care Act, and the Dodd-Frank Act) in a way that really has no comparable analogue for Democrats.

Redwood City-based financial startup Yodlee, which created the technology behind many online banking tools, is launching a new suite this week aimed at simplifying the books for small-business owners, the company told FOXBusiness.com. Rather than provide an accounting service, Connors says Yodlee aims to offer small-business owners a big-picture view of business finances. Beyond that, Marks says cloud-based accounting programs like Xero and FreshBooks are making headway in the market, especially among younger business owners. Marks says he does see a major disconnect between banks and many of their small-business customers, but that said, he is skeptical a new product will change things. Either theyre offered consumer services, which are not robust enough to fit their needs, or the business banking [for larger companies] is overkill, says Gibson.

1038,"While the United States searched in vain for moderate rebel groups to support, Iran and Hezbollah intervened on behalf of the Syrian government and managed to stabilize the military situation and to make it clear that the Syrian government was not going to fall. Trump’s Syria Dilemma.It is hard to see how the direction of the Trump administration's policy toward defeating ISIS can have a positive outcome. At this stage, it appears that that the Trump administration has delegated decision making concerning the force levels, strategy and tactics required to quickly defeat ISIS to military commanders on the ground. In southern Syria, an area that has been relatively stable, Israel, a U.S. ally, has taken advantage of the fluid situation to attack Hezbollah and Syrian government forces. Russian airpower and advanced weaponry quickly changed the military balance and gradually the Syrian government has reclaimed territory lost to the rebel forces and ISIS. During the presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump criticized President Obama as being out of touch with what it would take to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In northern Syria, the Kurdish Peoples Defense Force (YPG), backed by the United States and in cooperation with the SAA, is engaged in a three-way struggle against ISIS and Turkey, a member of NATO. President Trump has announced a 68-nation summit on defeating ISIS; however, Iran and Russia, the most effective forces fighting ISIS, have not been invited. Jordan, also an American ally, sees this as a major security threat that may require military intervention in coordination with the SAA. The success of the Russians and the Syrian Arab Army (SAA) has significantly complicated the positions of the other states supporting the rebels and ISIS. As the YPG and the SAA, with U.S. and Russian support, close in on Raqqa, the self-proclaimed capital of the Islamic State, Turkey, fearing the establishment of an independent Kurdistan allied with Kurdish rebels inside of Turkey, is pushing back. Turkey has made vague promises about retaking Raqqa, but without a major role for YPG forces, there is no chance that the Raqqa operation can succeed absent a significant U.S.",0,4
12157,"We Should Now Have a Separation of Capitalism and State.One of the foundational principles put forth in the early decades of the American experiment was the notion of separation of church and state.#160; Thomas Jefferson wrote, Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, thus building a wall of separation between Church and State. The CBO or some other institution could examine corporations and how their practices serve the common good.#160; The local, state, and national governments could establish educational standards where children would learn that there are other economic systems/faiths and that there exists a wall separating these faiths and the government. Moreover, a state such as this, we might also imagine that religious and state leaders will work together to maintain the religious hegemon, which will accompany greater power and privileges for the states religious figures and their followers. Just as there must be vigilance regarding the wall between#160; the church and state so that religious freedom is preserved, so too#160; ongoing vigilance would be needed to keep capitalism from corrupting the government and making citizens serve the market. Just to be clear, those who supported the wall of separation did not mean they thought religious people would not exercise their freedom to vote for individuals who represented their religious views or to influence local, state, and federal policy makers. The resulting market society operates like a theocracy or a parliamentary system that identifies one particular religion with the state. When a sole religion becomes state sanctioned, its leaders tend to serve in positions of power within the state or have undue influence in making policies and laws that favor their religion. Jefferson and others recognized that when the state promotes a religion, political freedoms, in general, and religious freedom, in particular, are diminishedat least for those who wish to practice a different faith",1,1

For nothing would be more appropriate than for the foul-mouthed cynic Emanuel to receive the nomination of the Party of Blogojevich, not to mention numerous felons large and small who have for generations made the Chicago Democratic Machine a virtual synonym for sleaze, corruption and opportunism. Emanuels access to the highest echelons of the Democratic Party corporate establishment and to attendant hordes of cold cash for the asking makes it a good bet that he will waltz through the Democratic Party primary campaign one which will amount to a coronation ceremony rather than a competition. While in no way rejecting their core values, recent Chicago pols, most notably those in the Obama circle, would appear to differ from their troglodyte forbears: the tasteful cut of their suits, their Ivy League discourse, their apparent command and adherence to bureaucratic and procedural detail would seem to mark them as a distinct species.

14264,"If a church embraces and communicates a kingdom vision rather than an institutional mission, her members will see their lives and work as part of Gods larger purpose, the founder of the Denison Forum on Truth and Culture in Dallas said. When a congregation understands the mission of Gods kingdom reaches beyond the ministries inside the churchs four walls, it may result in a reordering of priorities in terms of what leaders expect from members, Sherman noted. Many seminaries fail to give attention to issues of vocation and the integration of faith and work, said Sherman, a senior fellow both at the Sagamore Institute and at Baylor Universitys Institute for Study of Religion. Even when preachers include stewardship of time and talents, emphasis on their use at church typically trumps application to the workplace or community. The problem is that there is much in the life of the churchour language, our music, etc.that inadvertently can entrench the sacred/secular dichotomy, said Sherman, author of Kingdom Calling: Vocational Stewardship for the Common Good. In the process, churches communicate the message, The real work that matters in the kingdom is the spiritual stuff, she said. When churches and their leaders gain a clear understanding about Gods kingdom that transcends the local congregation, members expand their concept of vocation and stewardship mean, theologian Jim Denison noted. Churches commission missionaries and honor Sunday school teachers, but they may never recognize members who view their marketplace professions as places of ministry, she noted. I think most pastors do desire to see their people apply their faith to all areas of life and not compartmentalize it. Therefore, you will scale back the responsibilities required of church members for the work of sustaining the institutional churchbecause you recognize that sustaining the institutional church is not what the purpose of the church is. And some preachers dont preach on the workplace because they lack significant work experience apart from church settings. Kingdom calling is not about a churchâ€TMs institutional survival.Stewardship sermons often focus on finances.",0,2

9767,"Women in the Obama Administration Came Up With a Clever Strategy to Make Themselves Heard.By April M. Short / AlterNet Its a subtle form of sexism, and it happens all the time: A group of men and women are meeting and the men end up dominating the conversation (often without realizing theyre doing it). If and when a woman gets a solid moment to voice her idea, more often than not, the men in the group will pass it over. This is such a common phenomenon that the women of the Obama administration pinpointed it, met to address it and came up with an ingenious way to make themselves heard in meetings. Amplification, Eilperin explains, goes like this: When a woman made a key point, other women would repeat it, giving credit to its author. As late as the Eisenhower administration, the only women working in the West Wing were secretaries and they were barred from dining with men in the White House mess, Eilperin explains. They often end up trampling over women who interject, and changing the topic on women who raise a point. This forced the men in the room to recognize the contribution and denied them the chance to claim the idea as their own. Women now head half of all White House departments and maternity leave policies have improved. So, lets take a page from the women of the Obama White House and amplify. In a Jezebel article Stassa Edwards recently pointed out, the West Wing now has pumping rooms for nursing mothers and an impressive 12-week paid leave policy. Or theyll weave the conversation in such a way that, in the end, a man ends up taking credit for the womans idea. As Eilperin notes, the White House has a glass ceiling that has yet to be cracked in more than 200 years, as men have had a lock on the Oval Office.",1,1
14730,"We have a statute that lists nine reasons for which you can be evicted and if your landlord wants to kick you out for anything other than that, he cant, said Anne Smetak, an attorney at the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, which advocates for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. One legal aid attorney said judges should more carefully scrutinize eviction cases where a mortgagee is the plaintiff and delay the case until mortgagees provide proof that tenants wont be displaced. In Illinois, whoever holds the mortgage on a property has the right to evict tenants in a building whose loan is in default at any point during and after the foreclosure lawsuit has been filed, as long as the tenant receives ample notice of the eviction and an opportunity to contest it in court. In Cook County in 2007, there were 2,497 two to six-unit apartment buildings that went into foreclosure, according to a Chicago Reporter analysis of mortgage foreclosure filings compiled by the National Training and Information Center, a Chicago-based group that organizes communities around issues of racial and economic justice. In that case, the appeals court reaffirmed the right of a woman to stay in her apartment after the Veterans Administration took possession of the four-unit building in which she lived. If the tenant doesnt show up in court to tell the judge he lives there, an eviction will likely occur, Becker says. This law is an extremely valuable tool for keeping tenants in their homes, said Julie Becker, a senior staff attorney at The Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia. Mortgagees, who hold the mortgage on the foreclosed property, often send notices to the homes ostensibly destined for their former landlordssaying they must move in 30 days. Twenty-three years later, in the midst of the worst foreclosure crisis in the nations history, it has become clear that the districts law needs more teeth, Becker said. Mortgagees should be aggressively charged with figuring out if there are any tenants in those properties before they try to proceed with any eviction action, she said.",0,2

The Commerce Department said on Tuesday non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rebounded 1.7 percent last month after falling 0.4 percent the prior month. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast orders for durable goods, items from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last at least three years, falling 0.6 percent last month after rising 9.2 percent in September. Continue Reading Below Economists had expected so-called core capital goods orders to fall 0.5 percent. Businesses are cutting back on capital spending, wary of automatic government spending cuts and tax increases, known as the fiscal cliff, that are scheduled to kick in early next year unless the U.S. Congress and the Obama administration can agree on a plan to cut the budget deficits. Shipments of non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, used to calculate equipment and software spending in the gross domestic product report, slipped 0.4 percent. Business spending is also being undermined by the long-running debt problems in Europe and slowing global demand, especially in China. Durable goods orders were unchanged in October as gains in machinery, fabricated metal products, and computer and electronic products offset the drag from automobiles, defense and civilian aircraft. Excluding transportation, orders rose 1.5 percent after increasing 1.7 percent in September. The fiscal cliff could drain about $600 billion from an already fragile economy.

Preschool for All, Head Start, and accredited child care programs will not automatically be given a fourth-level rating, though compliance with specific regulations will count toward meeting some of the quality requirements. In its grant application, the proportion of low-income 4-year-olds whom the state hopes to enroll in high-quality preschool programs has been reduced to 65 percent, and the state now aims to provide five years of early childhood services to just 10 percent of students. The targeted communities will get discretionary funding to meet specific local needssuch as money for child care providers to gain state certification or bilingual endorsementscoaching to improve teaching, and support for outreach to the most high-need students. For one, part of the grant that offers extra support to improve quality, and screen and enroll more children in high-need communities, has been cut in half. The state will study whether quality ratings correspond to different outcomes for students, and also is planning a public awareness campaign to increase parent demand for highly rated programs. Programs can reach the second level by verifying that staff and leaders have received a certain amount of training. Only six to eight high-need communities will get extra support under the states plan, down from 15 in the original proposal. The third level will require programs to rate their own quality, but state contractors will spot-check programs to ensure accuracy. This represents a less than 1 percent increase in what we are spending on early childhood care and education in the state.

Draft language that has been floated by the industry to legislators would allow natural gas extraction to continue with almost no regulation. Colorado Rep. Diane Degette (D) is also sponsoring House legislation that would bring fracking materials back under the Safe Drinking Water Act and force companies to make public the chemicals they use. Despite this, the natural gas industry maintains that their fracking fluids are perfectly safe, and that their composition represents proprietary information that they shouldnt have to disclose. Will legislators use the climate bill as an excuse to let the natural gas industry run roughshod over clean water standards? In 2005, the industry successfully lobbied to have fracking fluids exempted from the Safe Drinking Water Actmeaning companies dont have to report exactly what theyre blasting into the ground. But a House investigation last month revealed that natural gas extraction companies like Halliburton have, in recent years, illegally injected hundreds of thousands of gallons of diesel into the ground. The fuel emits 30 percent less carbon dioxide than oil and 45 percent less than coal, and is often touted as the bridge fuel to renewable energy sources, as its relatively easy to modify coal-burning plants to use natural gas. A recent report from the Environmental Working Group found that a single fracking site can contain enough benzene and other toxic chemicals to contaminate the amount of water New York state uses in a day. Fracking uses a high-pressure blast of chemical compounds, sand, and water to fracture rock and access natural gas.

Citing a TV management directive, the semi-official Fars news agency said scenes that depict complicated love stories, and are therefore ""provocative"", are unacceptable viewing fodder.

No more Mr Naked Guy, as Iran clamps down on TV rules.As part of its conservative crackdown, Iran has banned TV programs showing ""half-naked"" men and ""love triangles"". The directive, which was send to programming directors, stipulated that ""unnecessary mingling"" of men and women in scenes including weddings, family parties, work situations and celebrations must also be ""strictly avoided"", reported Bloomberg. In the past, many Iranians have used illegal satellite channels to access Western content and international news. While it was not clear what prompted the ban, Reuters reported that a few years back, a local soap opera called Forbidden Fruit was aired, which told the tale of an old man who left his wife after falling in love with a young girl. But Iran prohibited satellite dishes in the mid-1990s to stop the corruption of Iranian people through the spread of immoral programs.

373,"Probably no other state has a higher percentage of growth from trade than New Mexico, said Jerry Pacheco, president of the Border Industrial Association, a nonprofit industry group in Santa Teresa. President Donald Trump has called the North American Free Trade Agreement#160; maybe one of the worst trade deals ever signed anywhere, blaming cheap labor in Mexico for the loss of U.S. jobs and the $62 billion-plus trade deficit. As the three NAFTA countries of Mexico, the U.S. and Canada began what could be a long drawn-out battle to revamp the agreement, New Mexico has a lot at stake. Trade advocates hope NAFTA renegotiations will strengthen and modernize the agreement to include digital commerce, energy and better enforcement of rules of origin designed to ensure products are actually made in the United States, Mexico or Canada. To say southern New Mexico is engaged with trade with Mexico is an understatement. Back in the 1990s when the three countries began the bruising fight to create the worlds biggest trade market, Camden, an Indiana native, worked in the steel mills in Ohio. He was so worried he campaigned for Ross Perot, the independent candidate who once warned of a giant sucking sound as jobs went south to Mexico. The challenge, Camden said, is spreading that message beyond the border, where many workers view NAFTA as a threat a concern he once held. Camden credited trade with Mexico for helping his medium-sized, family-owned company create jobs in New Mexico, saying the company has grown to 57 employees, generating a $3million payroll. Camden was one of several business leaders from New Mexico attending a two-day trade summit organized by the Borderplex Alliance, which promotes regional economic development in southern New Mexico, El Paso and Ciudad Jurez. The region is one of the most dynamic global trade corridors and has a lot riding on the outcome of the NAFTA renegotiation talks in Washington.

In a statement released on Monday, Best Buy said that it is hoping to use Jolys long list of experience of turning around companies to help lead the struggling consumer electronic giants overhaul. The embattled retail chain reduced its fiscal 2013 earnings guidance, citing lower expectations on industry-wide sales and the uncertainty associated with several key product launches set for the second half of this year.

3721,"Obamas reset also meant that his government did not criticize Russias human rights record in order not to jeopardize Russian good will on disarmament, the Iranian nuclear program or transit rights for U.S. supplies to Afghanistan. Putin, himself, called Obama an honest person who really wants to change many things for the better and lauded the progress that Obama and Medvedev had made over the last four years since Obamas reset of Russian-American relations. However, Sogrin qualifies his remark by pointing to the influence of foreign policy circles in Romneys camp that favor a unilateral action by the U.S. in world affairs. Generally, however, Ryabov believes that Putin and the mainstream in government circles would prefer to continue dealing with Obama, because, so far, he has been flexible and does not meddle in Russias internal politics. Current Russian President Vladimir Putin was only slightly more diplomatic when he showed some understanding of Romneys pre-election rhetoric before adding that words like these were not appropriate for someone who aspired to be the leader of a superpower. Conservative forces in the Russian government, for their part, warn that Romney could use the missile defense system in Europe against Russia, in spite of NATOs promises to the contrary. The more assertive role that hawks want for the U.S. on the international stage, beyond what has already been realized, is hence more of a mirage and no threat to improved relations with Russia. Take for instance Russias suggestion to include Iran in possible Syria peace talks, a possibility which may not be that unlikely given that Iran already engaged in direct talks with the U.S. on Iraq in 2007. While acknowledging the basic differences between the candidates, Vladimir Sogrin, head of the Center for North American Studies at the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences, does not believe that Romneys policies toward Russia would be fundamentally different from the current presidents.

510,"Compared to this confusing and contradictory listing of business-friendly states, the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts/Amherst recently completed a study, Decent Work in America, to compare the treatment of workers with the overall business climate in each state. New Mexicos officials also thought they were given a poor rating because a large portion of their economy comes from mining, but Pollin said accident rates were excluded from the study because mining has a larger proportion of accidents than other industries and would bias the study. The states that have good work environments, higher wages, more job equality, and more rights for workers are not suffering from low job growth, fewer new business startups, or low economic growth rates, said Pollin. The study ranked each state in three categories: Job opportunities, including unemployment and part-time work; job quality, including average wages, adjusted cost of living, and health and retirement benefits; and workplace fairness, including gender equality, minimum wages, collective bargaining rights, and right-to-work programs, to form a work environment index. States at the bottom of the ranking, Pollin suggests, are in the South where workers are successfully divided along racial lines and have no history of workers organizing for better pay and working conditions. With the dearth of attention to the well-being of workers in most whats good for business owners studies, the creation of an index to measure the working environment is a healthy contribution to a fair analysis of economic issues. The CATO Institute dedicated to individual liberty, limited government and free markets publishes a yearly report on the fiscal policies of state governments and rewards those that cut taxes and spending with the highest grades, while those that increase spending and taxes receive the lowest grades. Little surprise here, for this libertarian-slanted think-tank promotes limited government, individual freedom and personal responsibility, while ranking workers rights and higher wages as less important. A study by the Pacific Research Institute, The U.S. Economic Freedom Index: 2004 Report, is an example of business-friendly attitudes, assuming that economic freedom can be measured by workers migrating to places where they can economically prosper and away from poorer areas",1,1

Across the last thirty years its hard to think of a Democratic candidate seemingly assured of his partys nomination who has had less of a baptism of sewage in the primaries than Senator John Kerry. The agenda of some of the folks within the veterans movement ultimately became confused and went way beyond trying to end the war, Kerry later told the Boston Phoenix. Kerry voted for Clintons crime bill and for Clintons Counter-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act which set the template for Bushs Patriot Act, which Kerry, who now loses now opportunity to belittle the insipid John Ashcroft, also saw fit to support. It was the party machine that pulled it out for Kerry, and once Kerry had got those two crucial victories, the overwhelming eagerness of Democratic voters to annoint an uncontested champion to go up against Bush carried him forward. Given his overall record, these burbles are not to be taken seriously, as anything beyond campaign insurance against the occasional populist talk of John Edwards, his sometime rival on the primary trail.

Weinstein Co. Staffers Reeling From Latest Harvey Revelations, Company’s Future in Doubt.The Weinstein Co. has been in a state of turmoil since last Thursday when the first revelations of decades of alleged sexual harassment by former leader Harvey Weinstein were disclosed by the New York Times. One insider said work at TWC has essentially ground to a halt while staffers digest the information disclosed in the New Yorker report. People knew Harvey did dirty things, said one TWC staffer. Its understood that some networks carrying TWC shows are looking at the possibility of buying them out entirely to keep the companys imprimatur off of shows particularly series that have yet to debut. Meanwhile, the toxicity of the stories has prompted some of the companys creative partners to look for ways to distance themselves from the Weinstein Co.

1501,"""These new standards will help propel the auto industry forward by giving American families long-term relief from volatile fuel prices,"" said United Auto Workers (UAW) President Bob King. In order to reach these new standards, auto companies will have to invest more resources into alternative fuel vehicles, such as electric and hybrid cars, while also improving mileage on standard vehicles. The new standards require that the average efficiency of new cars and trucks made by American auto companies be increased to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. ""After years of billion-dollar investments by automakers, consumers have a lot of choice in fuel-efficient cars and light trucks,"" said the Auto Alliance, an auto industry trade group, in a statement. The administration estimates that the new rules will reduce American oil consumption by 12 billion barrels while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions by six million tons. Obama Administration Announces New Fuel Efficiency Standards.your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha Earlier today, the Obama Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules that will dramatically increase the efficiency of American-made automobiles. ""Cleaner vehicles that significantly reduce our nation's oil consumption are good for the auto industry and its workers, good for the environment and good for our nation's economy."" The BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor unions and environmental organizations, have detailed the expected benefits of the new fuel standards. In addition to jobs, American consumers will save $54 billion by 2030 through the new standards. ""These fuel standards represent the single most important step we've ever taken to reduce our dependence on foreign oil,"" said President Obama in a press statement. ""It'll strengthen our nation's energy security, it's good for middle class families and it will help create an economy built to last.""

Since then, the Air Force has drilled a widening circle of monitoring wells sometimes willingly and sometimes in response to pressure from the state and others to determine how far the fuel has spread. While not an official agency estimate, the new number does escalate concerns about the extent of the spill and whether the Air Force is moving aggressively enough to clean it up. Editorial: New Fuel Leak Estimate Should Spur Action..................................................................................................................................................................................... For now, Albuquerques water supply remains safe from contamination after a decades-long jet fuel leak on Kirtland Air Force Base. The state has asked the Air Force to drill even more wells to determine how close the contamination is to the drinking water supply. The Air Force currently is installing giant vacuum machines into the heart of the contaminated area that will begin sucking out and burning off jet fuel later this year. But the latest results show evidence of jet fuel in groundwater more than a mile from the source of the leak and less than two miles from the nearest city well. The Air Force, the state Environment Department and the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority should put their bureaucratic heads together and decide what they agree on, what they dont and what they can do to remove the threat. They will join the soil vapor extractors Ford engines that suck the jet fuel out of the ground and run off the same product that the base has been using for several years. But the amount of fuel that leaked from an underground pipe at an aircraft fuel loading facility could be triple the amount previously estimated.

Someone who has enough land for 300 mustangs to run on for the rest of their lives would be the perfect solution. I figure in todays economy, its hard to find people to adopt horses, the Farmington-area woman said. The alternative, she fears, would be too many horses on land that cant support them. That project died, though, for lack of support for spending that much money on land that could support only 25 to 30 horses. Bill Richardson had proposed spending $2.9 million to buy the Ortiz Mountain Ranch near Cerrillos for a wild horse sanctuary. I would like to see one big one, she said, while adding that she wouldnt turn down smaller ones that could handle one or two bands of mustangs.

The bigger, more important point, though, is I think for any serious investor, both the quarterly earnings themselves and the reaction to quarterly earnings shouldn't play a big part in your outlook as an investor.

Defense attorney Jerryl Christmas also suggested Monday that St. Louis County police may have used excessive force when arresting the suspect, Jeffrey Williams, saying his client had bruises on his back, shoulders and face and a knot on his head. Defense attorney Jerryl Christmas said that his client was not targeting police officers or aiming at the demonstrators. ""This wasn't any type of ambush shooting,"" Christmas said in an interview with The Associated Press, countering an earlier description by St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar of the March 12 shooting outside Ferguson police headquarters. Christmas said that Williams was aiming at someone with which he had a dispute. The police countered the attorney's statement, saying the excessive force accusation was ""completely false."" Suspect Jeffery Williams was seen by a nurse before he was admitted to lockup. The shooting took place after a DOJ report found racial bias from the city's police. Williams appeared in court yesterday on charges of felony assault, armed criminal action and a weapons offense. ""We're not sure we completely buy that part of it,"" the prosecutor said Sunday.

Larry Barcella, one of the prosecutors, agreed that it was inconceivable that such a crime could have occurred without Pinochets authorization. Even though all the evidence in the terrorist bombing of Letelier and Moffitt points directly to Pinochet, Bush has not demanded that Chile extradite him to the United States. The receptionist at the Institute for Policy Studies, in between shrieks and sobs, informed me of the identity of the three people in the sabotaged car, Orlando Letelier, Ronni and Michael Moffitt my colleagues, my friends. A bust of Ronni Moffitt and Orlando on Sheridan Circle brings some passersby to ask about how a Chilean general whom the U.S. government had supported in a military coup ordered a terrorist act in Washington. He told the Bureau that a Chilean agent named Wilson had come to recruit the Castro-haters for an assassination job. In less than two years, FBI investigators uncovered the relevant details of the terrorist plot that took place less than a mile from the White House. When FBI agents interviewed me hours later and asked me who might have done the dirty deed, I replied DINA. One drove and the other pushed the remote control buttons to set off the bomb as Leteliers car entered Sheridan Circle. I had foolishly assumed that an FBI Agent would know that DINA stood for Chiles intelligence and secret police agency. Bush, like previous U.S. presidents, has done nothing to seek the extradition of Pinochet, who perpetrated the terrorist act of September 21, 1976. Indeed, Bush has harbored anti-Castro terrorists like Luis Posada Carrilles and Orlando Bosch, both implicated in the sabotage of a Cuban commercial airliner three weeks after the Letelier bombing.",1,1

Trina Hepker, a special education teacher in her first year at Franklin, was browsing the internet in search of the perfect animal to serve as a classroom pet to her handful of students with special needs. Franklin Elementary School in Muscatine, Iowa was seeking a comparable alternative, and found one on a farm -- sort of. The average life span for a teacup pig is 12-15 years, so Frankie is expected to be a fixture at the school for years to come. Hepker felt she was getting the quality of a therapy dog, but in a smaller, cheaper package. Wester said Frankie has a calming presence for many students with special needs. The students also practice counting as they fill an empty one-liter bottle with Cheerios, Frankie's favorite snack. Frankie became part of the Franklin team in November, and Hepker said she's already teaching the students responsibility. Frankie, a three-month-old teacup mini potbelly pig weighs in at right around six pounds. As Wester puts it, ""There's a good chance that Frankie's longevity might exceed Trina and my longevity.

Saudi Arabia said in a statement that the funds would be deposited in Yemens Central Bank to help address the deteriorating economic situation faced by the Yemeni people.

Saudi Arabia to Transfer $2 Billion to Yemen.RIYADH, Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabias King Salman ordered the transfer of $2 billion to Yemen on Wednesday, a day after Yemens Saudi-backed prime minister made an urgent appeal on the kingdom and its allies to save the local currency from complete collapse. Prime Minister Ahmed Obeid bin Daghir had called on the kingdom and its allies to act now, not tomorrow, and said saving the Yemeni rial means saving Yemenis from inevitable famine. However, the governor of the Aden bank, Monasser al-Quaiti, said last year that the Saudi-led coalition had blocked 13 flights bringing cash into the country and was strangling its economy. The United Nations calls Yemen the worlds worst humanitarian crisis. The rial, trading at 500 to the dollar, has lost half its value since the war began in March 2015. Food and fool prices have skyrocketed and hundreds of thousands of civil servants have not been paid in more than a year, including doctors and nurses at government-run hospitals. The economic collapse has contributed to the breakdown of basic services, which in turn has fueled a cholera outbreak that has killed some 2,000 people and infected about 1 million so far.

4113,"In early 2009, the Obama Administration made a series of controversial decisions that may well have saved the United States and the world from a second Great Depression. Although this is a complex and cumbersome process, steady pressure from the financial sector will bolster it, and some Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2018 will not resist it as full-throatedly as they might have under more favorable circumstances. One wonders what might have been different if President Obama and his advisors had paid more attention to the politics of policy structures. As the discussion proceeds within the Republican Party, more elements of continuity are likely to emerge for the simple reason that many of the popular features of Obamacare cannot work without other features that critics reject. And he could weaken the Obama Administrations main vehicle for meeting its Paris obligationthe Clean Power Planby declining to defend it in federal court, where it is now under legal challenge. That said, it is hard to see how key features of the law, such as the expansion of Medicaid to cover ten million additional Americans, can survive a determined Republican effort to reduce the programs scope and cost. He discharged this burden so well that, despite the lingering racism that disfigured the 2016 presidential campaign, he normalized the idea of African-American leadership at the highest levels of government. Taken together, these policies helped avert outright disaster, an achievement for which Obama receives far too little credit but which the new Administration cannot undo. It seems inevitable that Republicans will move quickly to repeal the Presidents signature health-care legislation, even if they are not ready to agree on a replacement. Hillary Clintons narrow loss exposed a basic realitythe pervasive weakening of the Democratic Party during the eight Obama years, in part because the party machinery stepped away from its party-building mission.

As a first sign of a new relationship with Laos, Obama said his administration would address the legacy of war. The outreach is a core element of Obama's attempt to shift U.S. diplomatic and military resources away from the Middle East and into Asia in order to counter China's dominance in the region and ensure a foothold in growing markets. For Obama, the visit serves as a capstone to his yearslong effort to bolster relations with Southeast Asian countries long overlooked by the United States.

1027,"Installment-payout life insurance gives those who purchase the policies more control over their death benefit, which many have been looking for, Bloink says. Installment payouts not only give the insured more control over what happens to the benefit paid upon death but also can offer some cost savings upfront, Roth says. ""But the insurance company also will pay interest to the beneficiary on the remaining $900,000 death benefit that is retained pursuant to the installment-payout designation,"" says Bloink. Another potential plus is that a life insurance benefit paid out in installments may withstand inflation. Known as ""installment-payout life insurance"" (though Minnesota Life uses the term ""income protection agreement"" to describe its installment plan), this relatively new product allows the insured to choose how the policy's proceeds will be disbursed. Depending on the payout plan you choose, your premiums may be lower because the insurance company will hold on to at least part of your money over a longer period of time. Given these considerations, a person considering installment-payout life insurance might want to consult first with a trusted financial adviser. When payouts are made in installments, ""at the end of the day the beneficiary receives the full amount of the benefit,"" says Catherine Theroux, a spokeswoman for LIMRA, an insurance and financial services trade group. Although the son must pay taxes each year on the interest he receives, the interest should compensate in whole or in part for inflation, Bloink says. So, there's now a life insurance option allowing people who buy policies to select installment payments for their death benefit. One of the main reasons people buy life insurance is to replace their income that others are depending on after they have passed. The insured can't predict what the future holds for his or her spouse or other survivor, who might need the life insurance proceeds in a lump sum.",1,3

Like wiley Odysseus seeking to steer between the twin perils of Scylla and Charybdis, so must the United States avoid being bullied by an emerging China, while at the same time avoid being pushed into unnecessary conflict with China by its Pacific allies. In fact, when asserting their rights, the Chinese refer to the Monroe Doctrine by which an emerging US warned the European powers to stay out of the affairs of the Americas. The US has a treaty commitment to defend Japan, but at the same time the US has an interest in not letting Japan, or its other Pacific allies, be too provocative towards China. Freedom of navigation has been a tenant of American foreign policy since the US first broke free from Great Britain. Since both Taiwan and China officially agree that there is only one China, Beijing could say that Diaoyu is now back under de jure Chinese sovereignty, while Japan could say that it didnt give in to Chinas demands on Senkaku. I have often thought that a perfect solution would be for Japan to sell the disputed islands to Taiwan. They do not want to be treated",0,2

The questions not asked are apparently what has so many Americans leaving news broadcasts in search of thorough content. The primary concern for people who gave up on an outlet seems to be quality, the report found. While about one-third of Republicans and independents stopped turning to a news outlet, just one-quarter of Democrats did, the report found. In 2012, a continued erosion of news reporting resources converged with growing opportunities for those in politics, government agencies, companies and others to take their messages directly to the public, reports a new study from the Pew Research Centers project for excellence in journalism. Most interesting however, is who is leaving news outlets: People who said they had forsaken a news outlet were more likely to be men than women, older than younger, richer than poorer and Republican or independent rather than Democratic. When asked which they noticed more, fewer stories or less complete stories, far more people said the latter (24 percent to 61 percent). The report found that thoroughness in the stories was the biggest problem. While reduced thoroughness in stories was the more prevalent response among adults overall who were aware of the struggles, the split was not nearly as wide 48 percent versus 31 percent.

That makes CRISPR stocks such asEditas Medicine(NASDAQ: EDIT), along with life sciences conglomerateThermo Fisher Scientific(NYSE: TMO), the unsung heroes of CAR-T. Advertisement There's still a good deal of uncertainty about which method will be best for producing genetically engineered T cells -- a central part to the safety and efficacy of the therapy. Thermo Fisher Scientific has been quietly positioning one of its fastest-growing product portfolios for growing high-quality T cells, a process also called expansion. One of the more promising partnerships is with Editas Medicine, which is exploring ways to leverage the next-generation gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to engineer T cells. It may seem trivial, but the methods used can affect how long the immune cells remain active inside the body, how well they perform inside the body, their shelf life, and whether or not they contain the genetic edits made in the previous step. It also hints that CRISPR stocks such as Editas Medicine and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the unsung heroes of CAR-T today, will become much more appreciated by investors tomorrow.

Once again, the correctionuttered in this case by the president himselfoften backfired in the study, making belief in the falsehood that Obama is a Muslim worse among certain study participants. Among survey respondents who were very pro-Palin and who had a high level of political knowledge, the correction actually made them more likely to wrongly embrace the false death panels theory. In a paper just published in Pediatrics, Brendan Nyhan of Dartmouth University and his colleagues showed that presenting people with information confirming the safety of vaccines triggered a backfire effect, in which people who already distrusted vaccines actually became less likely to say they would vaccinate their kids. But in one case, the people were said to be farmers in upstate New York (in other words, victims who were quite socially similar to the research subjects); in the other, they were described as farmers from either Georgia or from France (much more distant victims). And if thats still not enough, yet another Nyhan and Reifler study examined the persistence of the President Obama is a Muslim myth. The intent of the article was to raise concern about the health consequences of climate change, but when Republicans read the article about the more distant farmers, their support for action on climate change decreased, a pattern that was stronger as their Republican partisanship increased. (When Republicans read about the proximate New York farmers, there was no boomerang effect, but they did not become more supportive of climate action either.) The study found that conservatives who read the correction were twice as likely to believe Bushs claim was true as were conservatives who did not read the correction.

4578,"The irony is that the U.S. corporate news media deserve harsh criticism for coverage of the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq not for possibly getting one fact wrong, but for failing to consistently challenge the illegality of both wars and the various distortions and lies that the Bush administration has used to mobilize support for those illegal wars. The frustration with U.S. policy that fuels these demonstrations isnt limited to the Quran incident, and to reduce the unrest to one magazine story is misleading. Demonize the news media to disguise the real causes of the resistance to occupation and divert attention from failed U.S. policies. And given that even the human-rights commission of the generally compliant Afghan government is blocked by U.S. forces from visiting the prisons, its not hard to believe that the U.S. officials may have something to hide. Given the abuse and torture from sexual humiliation to beatings to criminal homicide that has gone on in various U.S. military prison facilities, its not hard to believe that the Quran stories could be true. In a short item in its May 9 issue, Newsweek reported that U.S. military investigators had found evidence that U.S. guards had flushed a copy of the Quran down a toilet to try to provoke prisoners. Yes, people died during demonstrations, and political leaders in the Muslim world have cited the Quran stories to spark anti-U.S. feeling. Given that last month U.S. officials pressured the United Nations to eliminate the job of its top human-rights investigator in Afghanistan after that official criticized violations by U.S. forces in the country, its not hard to be skeptical about U.S. motives. Meanwhile, after the original story ran, Afghan and U.S. forces fired on demonstrators in Afghanistan, killing at least 14 and injuring many others.

Besides, as Chesney notes (PDF), part of the reason there was no material-support law at the time of Kings activism was because of the backlash from American checkbook revolutionaries like King.

One of those named in the Kentucky lawsuit said Trumps words inspired him to take action against the protesters and also expects the president to keep his promise and pay damages if the plaintiff wins the case. But as MSNBC reported, Trump also told supporters at a rally in Iowa just a month before the one in Kentucky that if you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of him, would you?

On Wednesday evening, protesters attempted to shut down a lecture I was giving at University of Wisconsin-Madison and police officers were told to stand down by the administration. That would mean that 20 protesters could simply stick around, and by doing so, prevent 450 people from hearing a lecture on free speech. The administration made clear that theyd shut down the event if I was a speaker, so the group attempted to register me as a guest. Why didnt security clear them out, even when they marched down to the front of the stage and attempted to block me physically from the audience? Because the administration had told university police not to remove protesters and if they had to remove the protesters, they should shut down the entire event. Since the 1960s, there have always been young people insistent on quashing free speech and destroying campus freedoms. There were also five or six local cops present, as well as a sheriff from Cook County to facilitate an arrest if security decided to move on me.

Those interests spent $15.7 million on a campaign that argued that allowing an off-reservation casino would set the stage for more Indian casinos closer to neighborhoods in cities in California. Rival Native American casino interests spent $18 million last year to defeat Proposition 48, which would have given permission for two other tribes to build a new casino near Madera, just north of Fresno, according to records filed by the campaigns.

If Pechanga tribal leaders would spend $2.3 million to block a casino 300-plus miles away, it boggles the mind to think how much theyd spend to block a fancy Indian casino project in the Los Angeles Basin. A separate committee that supported the ballot measure spent $631,000, much of it from the North Fork Rancheria of Mono Indians, which planned to build the new casino near Madera, and the Las Vegas giant Station Casinos Inc., a partner in the project. They said not to trust promises that Indian tribes wouldnt try to acquire land in big cities and get around requirements that casinos only be built on tribal territory.

ADVERTISEMENT In one of its annual reports, the company said in 1999 that 90 percent of Thalomid prescriptions were for cancer and the drug earned more than $100 million a year in sales through 2005, when it earned approximately $389 million, the lawsuit said. While Thalomid and Revlimid, a successor derived from thalidomide, were later approved for limited cancer treatments, their widespread promotion in advance of approvals led Celgene from the verge of extinction to the multi-billion company it is today, the lawsuit said. Doctors can prescribe drugs for other purposes if they think they will be effective, and the company marketed the drug directly to them to treat blood cancers and tumors, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit also claimed Celgene used false and misleading statements and paid kickbacks to doctors to prescribe the drugs. Brown was an immunology specialist trained by Celgene to promote Thalomid and Revlimid drugs for cancer treatments that had not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the lawsuit said. Their use in off-label indications was tantamount to human experimentation, Browns lawyers wrote in one court filing.

6460,"Gabe, 15, a local transgender teen who asked to keep his last name anonymous, said hes had to deal with depression caused by both societys expectations and the expectations he has for himself, his body and how he feels in it. Dresser said while many parents may be quick to assume a child who comes out as transgender is just going through a phase, that is usually not the case. Dresser said while seeing a therapist can help transgender individuals cope with depression, anxiety or other issues, its critical that they also connect with others who may be going through similar life changes such as through a support group. If someone is depressed, they tend to isolate themselves and its that isolation, where youre stuck in your own thoughts and it kind of spirals down and you want to get people out of that isolation, she said. Meeting other people who have successfully transitioned and are living the life they want can give hope to those who feel like its impossible. Surgery is one of those things that I need ASAP for my own emotional well-being and mental well-being, Johnson said. Anxiety in transgender people can often be caused by the trepidation of coming out to family members, deciding which bathroom to use, workplace situations that may arise and how to deal with being misgendered, Dresser said. Dresser said parents who have a transgender child should educate themselves on the subject as much as possible to provide them with the support they need. I can deal with society more than how I feel about myself because I know that society has a bad mind, but Im trying to get more loving toward myself, Gabe said. They know from the time theyre young that somethings not right.

In an editorial that ran the day the act was signed, The Arizona Republic called it odd that Apache County would come under a law aimed directly at ending discrimination in Southern states. ADVERTISEMENT Fulton doesnt think her mother and father ever registered to vote on county, state or federal matters. Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, director of the Indian Legal Clinic at Arizona State Universitys Sandra Day OConnor College of Law, said she still sees evidence of politicians trying to curtail Native American participation. Nellie Shirley, 81, from the tribal community of Lupton, said a man named Max Ortega took it upon himself to educate Navajos in the area about the importance of voting. Following that act, Apache County saw its first Native American county official elected and now reliably has representation in the Arizona Legislature and in city and county offices. Theres more of our people that got elected to the state and county offices, she said. The Arizona Supreme Court sided with Shirley in September 1973 and he was able to take his elected position nine months after his term was supposed to begin. And, as recently as 2003, Arizonas speaker of the House asked the state attorney general whether Navajos could serve on a state commission. Not even the most wild-eyed civil righter has ever claimed that the Indians in Arizona are prevented from registering and voting, the editorial said.

12345,"Two days later, another three-judge panel struck down Senate Bill 14, a voter ID law, because of how strict it was and the burden it would place on low-income and minority voters. The federal court even said that if GOP lawmakers had broadened the type of photo ID allowed, had Department of Public Safety offices open on the weekend, and considered the financial burden this could have on some segments of the electorate the decision would have been closer. Democratic State Senator Wendy Davis of Fort Worth, Texas, stated: Requiring photo identification could have, perhaps, been enacted fairly, but Governor Perry and state leaders insisted on forcing through a flawed law that would have wasted millions of taxpayer dollars without protecting a single vote. When there isnt evidence that a law will prevent the crime its supporters says it will and would end up disenfranchising more voters than it would protect it has, as the court noted, a retrogressive effect. The way many states have gone about the issue has fallen mostly on partisan lines, but there are people of several different political philosophies that would not have a problem with a law that required voters to show some form of identification at polling locations as long as the law is reasonable. Advocates of voter ID laws argue that state-issued identification is required for a number of things, including cashing checks and using credit cards. However, the law doesnt address the financial and accessibility hurdles that some voters would experience when acquiring the necessary documentation to obtain the ID. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott vowed to appeal both rulings to the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) and Republican leaders in Texas would like to see the matter resolved before the general election on November 6. The Department of Justice and Texas Democratic lawmakers focused on the effect these burdens would have on Hispanic voters in particular.

It may interest readers to know that similar job-killing claims have been made about the Massachusetts health care law, signed by Romney. Its true that some jobs would still lost, according to CBO it said some businesses could hire more part-time or seasonal workers instead of full-time employees, in order to avoid giving those workers insurance or paying a penalty. Republicans, such as Bachmann, seized on this as evidence that the CBO said the law would kill 800,000 jobs, but basic reading comprehension skills show thats not the case. What the Obama campaign chose to take issue with was how the then-candidates words were edited in a section where he is heard to say, If we keep talking about the economy, were going to lose. And health care expert John Sheils, senior vice president of The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that operates with editorial independence, told us shortly before the law was enacted that he estimated a small loss of jobs, around 150,000 to 300,000 low-wage jobs, a range that doesnt include increases in health and insurance sector employment. But, as weve written before, independent experts say the law will have a small or minimal impact on labor, and much of the effect will come from persons deciding to work less or retire earlier because their insurance is more secure and they receive subsidies to buy it.

12024,"Home prices will rise more slowly than rents because fewer investors are competing to buy a smaller supply of discount-priced foreclosures, while the inventory of non-distressed properties is growing as prospective home sellers gain equity with appreciating prices, Olsen said. The rental vacancy rate dropped to 7.4 percent in the quarter, creating a shortage of about 350,000 homes by historic standards and giving landlords leverage to raise rents. Demand for rentals has grown after owners of more than 5 million U.S. homes went through foreclosure since 2007, mortgage lending tightened and younger families postponed buying because they cant afford or prefer not to own property. Nationally, most of the new apartments being built are higher-cost units, which is limiting landlords ability to raise rents at the high end of the market while doing little to ease prices for tenants at the low end, Olsen said. In the New York metropolitan area, the largest U.S. housing market, the number of rental residences expanded by 63,000 to 3.4 million, with tenants spending a total of $50 billion for shelter. Zillow projects rents will increase 3.5 percent in 2015, compared with a gain in home values of more than 2.5 percent. ADVERTISEMENT The U.S. homeownership rate fell to 64.4 percent in the third quarter, an almost 20-year low, according to the Census Bureau. U.S. rents rose an average 3 percent this year, according to the Zillow report. That may change slowly as rents rise and the economy improves, said Skylar Olsen, senior economist at Zillow. Builders of multifamily homes broke ground at an annual pace of 340,000 in November, compared with an average 266,000 since 1994, according to Commerce Department data. Spending a lot for rent means its hard to save for retirement or a down payment and makes it more difficult to move from being a renter to being a homeowner, Olsen said in a telephone interview. The steepest increases were in areas where technology job growth and limited new development drove up housing costs.",0,0

Political law enforcement, using laws such as the so-called PATRIOT Act, is another widespread pattern that has drag netted thousands of innocent people into arrests and imprisonment without charges or adequate legal representation. Since the United States government is ruled by lawless men in the White House who have violated countless laws and treaties, Bush and Cheney clearly had no interest in placing giant corporate contractors operating inside Iraqi jurisdiction under either the military justice system or the criminal laws of the United States. They neither gave citizens legal standing to go to court and hold the Presidency accountable, or to prevent the two other branches from surrendering their explicit constitutional authority-such as the war-making power-to the Executive branch. Out in the marketplace, environment and the workplace, the corporations have many tools forged out of their unbridled power to block aggrieved people from having their day in court or getting agencies or legislatures to stand up for the common folk. Being above the laws reach, Bush and Cheney can and do use the law in ways that inflict injustice on innocent people. The federal courts over time have refused to adjudicate cases they deem political conflicts between the Legislative and Executive branches or, in general, most foreign policy questions.

ADVERTISEMENT Trump became the first president in a quarter-century to address the federations convention, using the trip to Nashville as a backdrop for a White House report that included proposals to stimulate a segment of the national economy that has lagged behind others. Trump also highlighted the doubling of the threshold for the estate tax earning a standing ovation from the audience and the ability for companies to immediately write off the full cost of new equipment. The president also took credit for working to roll back the Obama administrations interpretation of the Clean Water Act, which had greatly expanded the list of bodies of water subject to federal regulation. ADVERTISEMENT Trump signed an executive order following his speech on rural broadband, aimed at easing the process to put private broadband infrastructure on federal property. Trump also called on Congress to renew the farm bill this year, adding he supports providing for federal crop insurance. Central to the report is the assessment that the provider for an equalization among rural America is connectivity; that high-speed internet should remain a high priority for the administration, said Ray Starling, the special assistant to the president for agriculture, trade and food assistance. Joined by Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and a group of Tennessee lawmakers, Trump said most of the benefits of the tax legislation are going to working families, small businesses, and who the family farmer. Those towers are going to go up and youre going to have great, great broadband, Trump told the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Roberson said the measure is intended to allow police agencies like Metro to continue to work with federal agencies as they do now.

When the offensive against Isis started on 17 October last year, it followed a military agreement between the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi central government whereby the Kurdish Peshmerga would play only a limited military role, taking part of the Nineveh Plain east of Mosul. Isis used 17 suicide car bombs from Mosul and some of their units from Syria to clear the road leading out of Mosul for a few hours, said Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdish President Masoud Barzani, in an interview with#160;The Independent. Mr Hussein says that it was a serious mistake in the planning of the Mosul operation to believe that Isis would be defeated quickly or the population might rise up against the jihadis. The only possible escape route out of Mosul for Isis is to the west, through territory held by the Hashd al-Shaabi Shia militia who were forced to retreat, enabling Isis briefly to gain control of the road. A serious problem in Iraq is that there is no political plan for sharing power or running the regained territory after the fall of Mosul and the defeat of Isis.

Pauls position on health care was regurgitated at the debate with a range of Republican talking points: People arent turned away from hospitals, church charity can cure the crisis, and medical costs are skyrocketing because individuals have stopped taking personal responsibility for their health care. I see no reason why the United States of America, the wealthiest country in the history of the world, spending 14 percent of its gross national product on health care, cannot provide basic health insurance to everybody. It leaves 23 million uninsured, denies undocumented immigrants health coverage, doesnt cover abortion unless women pay separately, and mandates that the uninsured buy expensive, high deductible, high co-pay health plans via complicated state insurance exchanges or face a financial penalty. Every person I interviewed, including a leading physician and one of the main event organizers, believed that health care was a human right and was in favor of a system run by the government.

The second Kerry claim that stem-cell inspired treatments for many dreaded diseases are imminent is even more irresponsible. Democrats are eager to discuss the issue, and Kerrys campaign rhetoric seems to have three objectives: first, to convince the nation that Bush has enacted a far-reaching ban on stem-cell research. When it comes to adult stem-cell research, Bush is a strong advocate, with the National Institutes of Health providing more than $180 million to researchers last year. Shortly after the death of President Reagan, who suffered from the disease, Kerry devoted one of the Democrats weekly radio addresses to this fairy tale, declaring that stem-cell research has brought us closer to finding ways to treat Alzheimers. In June, the Washington Post published a story, quoting many leading scientists in the field, that said stem-cell research was unlikely to lead to a cure for Alzheimers. In 2001, Bush reviewed the NIH guidelines implementing the law and decided to authorize funding for research on existing embryonic stem-cell lines in which the human embryos in question had already been destroyed. In response to such criticisms, First Lady Laura Bush accused Democrats of giving false hope to the sick and defended her husband, saying that the president is a great advocate of stem-cell research. The hard question for the nation is whether the search for cures justifies a national project of human embryo destruction. Good people will draw different ethical or political lines in the debate over stem-cell research. Many embryos are left over in fertility clinics but the idea that they are going to die anyway is not a convincing ethical argument for using them in research; otherwise, why not routinely use death row inmates as sources of organs?",0,4

Sears lost business to Walmart and Home Depot, as well as its place in the Dow Jones index of the nations most important companies in 1999. Staples had attempted a merger with Office Depot, but the Federal Trade Commission blocked that effort in 2016. Chief Financial Officer Jason Hollar tried to stick the proverbial finger in the dike, asserting, It is very important to reiterate that Sears Holdings remains focused on executing our transformation plan. The company lost $2.2 billion in the fiscal year ending in January; the last year it showed an annual profit was 2010. Macys has announced it is closing 68 stores and cutting 10,000 jobs.

Yet another study concludes that black mothers fourfold greater risk of death in comparison with white mothers persists even when controlling for age, socioeconomic status and education. The former Black Panther, a political prisoner for years, thus goes to the core of a society where new or expectant mothers are dying at rates far in excess of contemporary international norms. The study in Obstetrics and Gynecology indicated maternal deaths have long been under-reported due to flawed data collection by U. S. public health agencies.

A prevailing line of U.S. thought is to belittle the fact of social-class distinctions, and in that vein, as pointed out by critics such as public health expert Vicente Navarro, not a few academicians and officials use race as a proxy for class.

In other words, you can pay a large medical bill out of pocket and leave your money in your HSA to grow and compound tax-free until you need the reimbursement. As I mentioned, any money you use from your HSA for qualified healthcare expenses can be withdrawn 100% tax-free.

In order to open an HSA, you need to meet a few qualifications: Advertisement HSAs are offered by many major financial institutions, so a good place to start your search is your own bank. For the 2016 tax year, HSA account owners with single health coverage can contribute up to $3,350 to their account, and those over age 55 can contribute an additional $1,000. Continue Reading Below An HSA, or Health Savings Account, is designed to help people with high-deductible health insurance plans pay for their out-of-pocket medical expenses. Unlike the Flexible Spending Account (FSA), an HSA allows account owners to roll over all unused funds year after year, and also allows account funds to be invested in mutual funds, similar to a 401(k). For example, if you're single, the $5,500 IRA contribution limit is higher than what you'll be able to put in your HSA. So, take a look at the benefits of an IRA, compare them with those of an HSA, and choose the best savings option for you. However, I feel that the healthcare tax benefits of an HSA could outweigh any drawbacks for a majority of Americans.

Prince Khaled, the ambassador, said women would not need permission from their guardians to get a license or have a guardian in the car and would be allowed to drive anywhere in the kingdom, including the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Many younger Saudis regard his ascent as evidence that their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old and blocked womens progress. Some leading members of the countrys powerful and austere Sunni Muslim clergy have argued against women being allowed to drive, which they say could lead to them mingling with unrelated men, thereby breaching strict gender segregation rules. Our leadership thinks that this is the right time to do this change because currently in Saudi Arabia we have a young, dynamic, open society, he told reporters. The position of Saudi women gradually improved under late King Abdullah and since King Salman took over in 2015, the kingdom has been opening more areas for women through the governments modernizing reforms.

Following previous reports that Wasserman-Schultz was in negotiations with Capitol Police regarding the extent to which they could examine the seized laptop, she told the Sun Sentinel on Thursday that she has allowed an examination to go forward. The Washington Free Beacon reports that the accused staffers are believed to have had access to sensitive intelligence information related to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, as well as lawmaker's personal information, prompting concerns the breach could be far deeper than initially suspected. Regarding her exchange with Police Chief Verderosa, Wasserman-Schultz added: I was trying to get more information, I wanted to make sure they were following the rules. After the investigation went public, however, Wasserman-Schultz was forced to redefine Awans position as he was no longer permitted to access the House IT network. She also balked at the idea that Awan was fleeing the country because he filled out a form concerning his leave of absence, and bought a round-trip ticket. The back-and-forth continued, with Verderosa repeatedly noting that if the item in question is part of an ongoing case, then there are additional things that need to be done. Why did she wait so long to reveal the alleged motivations behind her defense of Awan and his laptop?

Marginalize or banish those who in any way make African-Americans, gays, single women or any other human being feel unwelcome in a party that cherishes the values of limited government, low taxes and freedom. The nitwits are well-enough known at this point those farthest-right social conservatives who couldnt find it in their hearts to keep their traps shut. And then there were Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann, who never had a real shot at the nomination and certainly could never win a national election, yet they refused to surrender to the certain nominee. Theres a reason Hispanics, including even Cuban-Americans this time, went for Obama.

14423,"In fact, there are a variety of reasons homeowners might want to work with professional contractors when tackling home improvement projects. But its important that homeowners recognize the many benefits of working with professional contractors before making any final decisions with regard to who will tackle their next project. Fearing potential problems down the road, some buyers might be put off by homes that were remodeled by DIYers and not professional contractors. ADVERTISEMENT Cost Conventional wisdom suggests its less expensive to do something yourself than to hire someone else to do it for you, but thats not necessarily true of home improvement projects. But no matter how simple popular home renovation television shows make remodeling projects appear, homeowners should know that such undertakings are far more difficult than they appear on television. Inspiration One oft-overlooked benefit of working with professional contractors is the likelihood that they can draw up ideas for projects that homeowners might otherwise never have thought of on their own. Veteran contractors can draw on years of experience to create designs that DIYers might be incapable of coming up with and/or incapable of seeing through to completion. In addition, contractors often purchase materials at a much lower cost than individual homeowners because contractors buy in bulk. Homeowners who overestimate their abilities and the time they have to complete projects can cost themselves substantial amounts of money. Experienced professional contractors with strong track records (seek recommendations from friends or neighbors) wont have to go through trial and error and are therefore more likely than DIYers to complete a project on time and on budget. But if homeowners want to showcase a newly remodeled kitchen when selling their homes, they should be prepared for prospective buyers to ask who worked on the project. Homeowners without specific ideas in mind can ask contractors to come up with various scenarios before committing to a particular one.",0,0

Senate to Take Another Run at ‘Fast Track’ Trade Deal.The Senate voted Thursday to start consideration of a bill giving President Obama fast-track authority to negotiate a massive 12-nation trade pact. Some liberal Senators also criticized the presidents trip last week to Nike's headquarters in the liberal-leaning community of Portland to make the case for the trade deal. Democrats, including some the White House had hoped would lend their support, refused to budge unless they got a vote on a customs bill which includes currency manipulation and enforcement provisions that the Democratic caucus supports but many Republicans and the White House oppose. The White House also faced criticism over the presidents back and forth with Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a former Obama administration official turned legislator, who has been one of the most vocal critics of the president's handling of the trade accord handling she says has lacked transparency. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) called the move by Democrats to block Tuesdays motion an example of Democrat on Democrat violence, and said he believed the meeting at the White House likely helped them get to todays deal I think the so-called pro-trade Democrats had a chat with the President for a couple hours and I think that helped, Cornyn said, I wish he would have had that chat before the first failed cloture vote. The Senate passed that measure as well as the African Growth and Opportunity Act a non-controversial trade preference program focusing on sub-Saharan African nations on Thursday before a procedural vote to begin debate on fast track authority on trade.

7958,"The real reason, Glick thinks, was the pressure hed been putting on the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program to accept patients with psychiatric diagnoses. The information that they would allow us to consider had to be filtered through rules stating that if its not a double-blind, peer-reviewed clinical trial, it doesnt get a lot of evidentiary weight. So, five years later I brought in the study Id done with OMMP registrants and asked them to reconvene the Debilitating Conditions Panel based on this new evidence showing that indeed there is some psychiatric effect that people are getting from their cannabis use. And then out of nowhere came a whole bunch of medical experts -psychiatrists from Oregon Health Sciences University and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill- and they just had fits. This may mean that the organic movement is reducing the tonnage of pesticides and herbicides drenching that luscious topsoil D.O., the osteopaths journal, has a cover story on cannabis in which Philip Leveque (whose license was revoked by the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners) is one of two advocates for the herb in a debate against 12 nay-sayers. Now the Supremes have ruled unanimously that Washburn does not qualify as disabled because the prescription drugs enabled him to sleep (albeit less well and with more side effects than marijuana). But attorney Phil Lebenbaum, expressed concern that the ruling limits the definition of a disability, and may affect workers in cases having nothing to with marijuana. After OMMA passed, Glick began seeing patients at Samaritan who said they were self-medicating with cannabis to ease various psychiatric symptoms. We assist these people by trying to find a physical correlation to their psychiatric symptom, Glick explains. Unlike Californias law, passed in 96, which authorizes doctors to recommend marijuana for any condition for which marijuana provides relief, the OMMA created a finite list of qualifying conditions: Cachexia (wasting), Cancer, Glaucoma, HIV+/AIDS, Nausea, Severe Pain, Seizures, including but not limited to epilepsy, and Persistent muscle spasms, including but not limited to",1,1

13067,"One of Obamas more easily achievable goals Tuesday night should be to remind voters and perhaps Romney himself, who seems to forget of previous Romney positions such as self-deportation for undocumented immigrants. Then, in his second debate with Mitt Romney, President Obama needs to offer not just history lessons and dire warnings, but also a hopeful vision for the next four years. Obama also needs to make his own promises to the American people. Obama tried to note the inconsistency, but Romney bulled his way through by simply insisting that up was, in fact, down. It would be hard for Obama to turn in a worse performance Tuesday night at Hofstra University than he did at the first debate in Denver. Obamas passivity in the first debate was so striking, and so surprising, that it overshadowed all the other ways in which the president failed. Romneys real success in the first debate was to look past the challenges the nation faces, and focus on the opportunities he sees ahead. The bigger and more important task is demonstrating to Americans they will have a brighter future with Obama in the White House for four more years. Obama needs to explain how the policies he has implemented, and those he plans to pursue, will make our lives better. This was Obamas biggest failure of the first debate or rather, Romneys biggest success. The nation has taken a huge step toward universal health insurance, and soon will come a day when Americans dont face bankruptcy just because they become ill.

4730,"Reuters: Kathleen Sebelius, named as U.S. health secretary by President Barack Obama, became his latest nominee to reveal income tax issues, saying on Tuesday she paid nearly $8,000 to settle errors over three years. Her mistakes appear honest and minor next to those of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who didn't bother to pay $34,000, despite warnings from the IRS (which he now oversees). Sebelius, the governor of Kansas, must pass a confirmation process in Congress before she can lead Obama's overhaul of the $2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare sector to cut costs and provide coverage to an estimated 46 million uninsured Americans. How many Americans this year will find themselves receiving that dreaded notice from the IRS and wondering what Cabinet post they might have filled? Another of Barack Obama's nominees has had to apologize for not paying her full taxes.

Witnesses to the grim events also alleged that 600 Taliban PoWs who survived the containers shipment to the Shebarghan prison were taken to a spot in the desert and executed in the presence of about 30 to 40 U.S. special forces soldiers (The Globe and Mail, 19 December 2002). An integral part of any such inquiry ought to be the contemporaneous statements of U.S. officials, notably Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who in the waning days of the Afghan invasion appeared to be cheerleading for the slaughter of prisoners. Now that U.S. abuses and atrocities against Iraqi prisoners up to and including murder have captured world headlines, there is no excuse for not investigating alleged crimes that, although they are receding into history, may have been incomparably worse.

A total of 21,000 Ebola cases have so far been reported since the outbreak began, killing 3,600 in Liberia alone. Two experimental vaccines were taken to a secure location in Liberia, which is one of the three countries along with Sierra Leone and Guinea that were hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak last year and have lost thousands of lives to the disease, according to a BBC report. The hope is to create a large stockpile of vaccines that is effective against Ebola, thus preventing another epidemic. For the trial, which begins Monday, scientists will inject a small amount of an Ebola strain into 12 volunteers to prompt the body to produce an immune response, and more and more volunteers will be immunized as the trial continues. A Liberian scientist, Stephen Kennedy, said in the BBC report that the vaccine posed no danger do volunteers, as the Zaire strain of the virus that was put into the vaccine is weak and wont cause Ebola. The World Health Organization says that the epidemic has reached the second phase, which is when the focus begins to shift onto ending the epidemic. The current crisis has been subsiding, with fewer cases reported each week. However, the pace of infection has dropped dramatically, with only five recent confirmed cases in the country. Scientists will immunize 30,000 volunteers from the virus, including health workers, according to the report. Is the end of Ebola near?

137,"Backing up its works, leaders of the 28 NATO members agreed to create a ""spearhead force"" of several thousand elite troops primed to deploy at short notice to defend eastern allies such as Poland and the Baltic states who are feeling vulnerable in the face of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Although Fogh Rasmussen and other NATO leaders insist the new stance doesnt represent a return to a Cold War-style standoff with Moscow, it's become difficult to view the relationship between Russia and the West in any other terms. NATO to Putin: Don't even think about messing with eastern allies.LISBON, Portugal NATO sent a blunt message to Moscow on Friday: If you even think about attacking one of our members, you will face the full might of the United States and all its European allies. NATO's top commander, US Air Force General Philip Breedlove, has said its deployment could be triggered by the sort of covert destabilization that Russia used in the early stages of its Ukraine action. More from GlobalPost:#160; The West is raising the stakes over Ukraine NATO officials have given assurances that alliance commanders will have leeway to deploy the force when needed, avoiding decisions on its use being bogged down by political differences among the allies should a crisis erupt. Decisions taken at the Wales summit have confirmed the alliances return to its core function of ensuring the collective defense of its members' territories after years when the focus has been on projecting security through ""out-of-area"" operations like those in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Libya. On paper, at least, NATO's conventional forces still outgun Russia's despite Putin's massive investment in defense in recent years and the steady decline in military spending by European members of NATO since the end of the Cold War. The more cautious European allies also ensured the NATO summit stopped short of agreeing to permanently station a large number of troops on the alliance's eastern borders.

9226,"And although Wall Street has extracted $13 trillion in bailouts just since October 2008, the thought of raising taxes on wealth to pay just $1 trillion over an entire decade for Social Security or health insurance is deemed a crisis that would lead Wall Street to shut down the economy. Wall Streets solution to balance the budget by cutting back the governments social contract and deregulating finance all the more will shrink the economy and make the budget deficits even more severe. Indeed, there simply is no time to discuss what kind of regulation is appropriate, except for the Feds familiar protective hand: delays are creating uncertainty, undermining the ability of financial institutions to increase lending to businesses of all sizes that want to invest and fuel our recovery. Californias real estate costs are just as high with its property taxes frozen, but the rising rental value of land has been paid to the banks forcing the state to slash its fiscal budget or else raise taxes on labor and consumers. The Greek government has pre-sold its tax revenues from roads and other infrastructure to Wall Street, leaving less future revenue to pay its public debt. It is simple mathematics to see that if the government cannot raise taxes, it must scale back Social Security, other social welfare spending and infrastructure spending. Throughout the world, scaling back the 20th centurys legacy of progressive taxation and untaxing real estate and finance has led to a public debt crisis. It is telling governments to shift to a regressive tax system to make up the fiscal shortfall by raising taxes on labor and cutting back public spending on the economy at large. The way to protect victims of predatory bank lending (and crooked sales of junk securities) is not new regulations but just the opposite: to simplify the patchwork quilt of regulatory agencies and improve transparency so that consumers and investors can punish excesses through their own informed investing decisions.

Referring to student debt, which has by now reached $1.2 trillion, Meister suggests, Add up the lifetime debt service that former students will pay on $1 trillion, over and above the principal they borrow, and you could run a very good public university system for what we are paying capital markets to fund an ever-worsening one. For the last four decades, easy access to credit has masked stagnating wages and crumbling social services, forcing many Americans to debt-finance necessities like college, health care, and housing, while the creditor class has reaped enormous rewards. In the past, American higher education has always been associated with upward mobility, but with student loan debt quadrupling between 2003 and 2013, its time to ask whether education alone can really move people up the class ladder. Financiers, as the universitys creditors, are promised ever-increasing tuition as the collateral on loans, forcing public schools to aggressively recruit ever more out-of-state students, who pay higher tuitions, and to raise the in-state tuition relentlessly as well, simply to meet debt burdens and keep credit ratings high. Its absurd: a single mother working two jobs and attending online classes to better her life is discipline personified, even if she cant always pay her loans on time.

Eventually, Jones and Baginski envision the organization being able to provide highly trained reporters to media organizations when a story seems too risky to tackle alone. Jones shows us how to analyze the urban landscape for creative ways to lose a minder: to mail something without being seen and to communicate with sources while going about our daily business. However, to get around its limitations (it requires a long key of random letters), Baginski invented his own cipher and teaches it in class. Baginski is fond of quoting Alexis de Tocquevilles 1835 study, Democracy in America, which held up U.S. democracy as a model for France: The press it is whose ever watchful eye exposes the secret motivations of politics and forces men in public life to appear one by one before the court of popular opinion. Only certain people should be worried: whistleblowers from the national security or intelligence communities (and possibly from megacorporations), and the journalists who work with them. Lowenthal, writing for the CPJ website, notes that the expenses necessary to protect key sources, such as hiring elite security teams instead of extra editors, can take a deep toll on newsroom budgets. That isnt to say you look over your shoulder all the time, but youre constantly aware of your surroundings and many potential adversaries. A cipher called the one-time pad can defeat computer analysis entirely and is still used by spies.

7005,"Then we investigate what happens if, in addition to economy-wide CO2 prices, Congress also imposed one of several transportation-specific measures: a strong gasoline and diesel tax, continuing to increase the passenger car fuel efficiency standards between 2020 and 2030, and aggressive performance-based tax credits for alternative motor vehicles. The overarching conclusion of this report is that reducing GHG emissions and fuel consumption in the transportation sector will be an enormous challenge that requires stronger policy initiatives than are currently being discussed by policy makers. We observe that artificially increasing the popularity of alternative motor vehicles through tax credits has the unintended effect of decreasing new conventional vehicle fuel economy as compared with implementing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards without the credits. Efficiency policies such as performance standards and purchase tax credits, while politically palatable, do not address growth in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), an important root cause of GHG emissions from transportation. Analysis of Policies to Reduce Oil Consumption and Greenhouse-Gas Emissions from the U.S. Transportation Sector.Paper - Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, Harvard Kennedy School Read a policymakers' summary of this papergt; As the U.S. debates an economy-wide CO2 cap-and-trade policy, the transportation sector remains a significant oil security and climate change concern. Third, purchase tax credits are an expensive way to reduce oil consumption and GHG emissions from transportation. The 2009 version of the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), an energy-economic equilibrium model of U.S. energy markets, is used to estimate the impacts of these scenarios-both in terms of carbon mitigation and economic costs. If there is a strict cap on emissions that must be met either with emissions reductions from covered sources or through purchases of offsets, our results imply that large purchases of offsets will be required. These results should, instead, serve as an indicator of the nature of impacts that would be observed in various transportation policy scenarios. At such prices,",0,0

Adeline Sire Simply put, where hygiene is concerned, your swimsuit cannot be something you could be found wearing outside the pool. If you are caught entering the pool with biking shorts, running shorts or trunks, lifeguards turned fashion police will blow the whistle and send you back to the lobby where you will be asked to purchase proper attire.

3646,"Consumer spending grew at a meager 0.1 percent annual rate in February, the government said Monday, matching January's unimpressive gain. This month, 28.7 percent of consumers said they expected stocks to rise over the next year. And employers added a healthy 242,000 jobs last month, helping keep the unemployment rate at an eight-year low 4.9 percent for a second straight month. ""The rebound in stock markets more than offset the impact of higher gasoline prices in recent weeks,"" Steve Murphy, U.S. economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. The Conference Board said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 96.2 this month after tumbling to a revised 94 in February. Consumer spending last year increased 3.1 percent. ""Given the very disappointing real consumer spending results for January and February, this pickup in confidence is good news,"" said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. The U.S. stock market got off to a dismal start in 2016, driven by fears of economic weakness overseas and plunging oil prices. Murphy at Capital Economics estimates that consumers' outlook is consistent with 2.5 percent to 3 percent annual growth in spending. The government said last week that the economy grew at the end of 2015 a bit faster than it had originally estimated. The Dow Jones industrial average had plummeted more than 10 percent this year through mid-February. A year ago, the overall consumer confidence index stood at 101.4.",0,0

As Gawker asked sardonically, You might not stop for the sake of your money, your police record, or your septum, but would you give up blow if you knew that every eight ball cost ten square meters of precious rainforest habitat, you Whole Foods junkie? Blame Cocaine.. Theres a new tactic to target casual drug users: Convince them drugs are polluting the planet. As the Guardian explained, Santos wanted to persuade casual British users, the social user who drove a hybrid car and was concerned about the environment to eschew the drug because of its environmental impact. While its true that in the last five years, production of cocaine in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru has increased almost 20 percent, the truth is that the destruction of the rainforest is not due to increased demand from wealthy British cocaine users. On Tuesday, according to the Guardian, Francisco Santos Caldern, the vice-president of Colombia, told a conference of British senior police officers: If you snort a gram of cocaine, you are destroying 4m square of rainforest and that rainforest is not just Colombianit belongs to all of us who live on this planet, so we should all be worried about it. Not only that, the money that you use to buy the cocaine goes into the hands of FARC, of illegal groups that plant mines, that kidnap, that kill, that use terrorism to protect their business. But while casual drug use certainly doesnt help, its not the main cause of environmental destruction; that award goes to Plan Columbia (.pdf). So yes, it is technically true that the cocaine industry is destroying the Columbian rainforest. Are casual users of cocaine really responsible for pervasive environmental destruction? It looks like Santos cant see the rainforest for the coke. As Mother Jones explained back in March 2007, this causes farmers to, sensibly, push further into the rainforest.",1,1

When I did it,it looked like they would have to be selling their product into every car in the world, except there would have to be more cars sellingevery year than there actually arefor it to even begin to make sense. Not areason to make the acquisition, of course, andhopefully it doesn't work out for Intel shareholders, but it's a relatively little bet for Intel. Cross: Yeah,if it doesn't work out, it is arelatively small write-off for Intel shareholders. That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Given Intel's well-publicized plans to transform its business, this full-speed investment in the driverless car industry will be important to follow.

Budget woes hit Spaceport recruitment..................................................................................................................................................................................... With the start of Virgin Galactic flights still a long way off, Spaceport America is struggling on a limited budget that leaves few resources for marketing. The idea is to create an industry ecosystem with a number of operators at the Spaceport and then companies that make things like rocket motors or propellants, Whitesides told the Journal in late October. And with Virgins commercial operations unlikely to begin until at least late 2016 following the crash of its rocket in the Mojave Desert, the Spaceport is facing a $1.5 million or higher budget deficit in the new fiscal year that begins next July. Still, apart from rocket-launching companies like Virgin Galactic, the Spaceport must recruit a range of supply firms to build up an industry cluster in southern New Mexico, something Virgin CEO George Whitesides recognized even before the Oct. 31 crash. A $13 million on-site visitor center, for example, was indefinitely postponed early this year to instead focus on a paved road from Las Cruces to the Spaceport a $14.5 million expense that constitutes the last major leg of construction pending at the facility. That earns extra revenue for the Spaceport, while drawing more attention from prospective businesses interested in potential operations in New Mexico. Its current operating budget is about $3 million, boosted since last year by about $2.6 million in lease fees from Virgin Galactic for installations at the Spaceport. Its a new facility and now is the time to really establish momentum. ADVERTISEMENT To date, the state has either earmarked or spent $218.5 million for Spaceport construction.

This means that Soll was capable of studying the way tumors grow and form particularly intricately and, later, had very few barriers to obtaining a near infinite supply of pricey specialized biological cures. Cancer, one of the most devastating and mysterious killers known to man, is the center of many peoples sadness and pain, even in an age of medical miracles. Most people have lost faith in a definitive cure for cancer but it remains the desperate hope of millions of people suffering from one of cancers many tragic incarnations. David Soll and his magic bullet might be the feel-good story you need today. But, like the champion this story deserves, he doesnt let his pain cloud his research. While researching at the University of Iowa, Soll and his team have been well equipped to fight cancer at its source. It feels like some sort of justice that the killer of a quarter of all human beings be slain in such a dramatic fashion by someone so deeply touched by its ravages. Thankfully, due to his disciplined work across the college of Biology, he can self-fund this research without fear of losing a vital research grant. Bringing an end to cancer with an antibody would be a miraculous, simple, and potent cure. His groovy aesthetic aside, Solls recent, self-funded, discovery could change the world.

10696,"It's possible that fewer states will spend more on corrections than they will on higher education in the future, but if that happens, it will probably be because sentencing reform succeeds and drops prison costs - not because funding for public universities is restored to pre-recession levels. Continue Reading Below The numbers come from the Kaiser Family Foundation report on the distribution of state general fund expenditures for fiscal 2013, so given the continuing downward trend of educational funding, more states may be in the same position by now. Finally, infrastructure needs are a priority in many states, as they should be - but they take even more funds out of the state budget. However, the largest discrepancy was in Oregon where corrections spending consumed almost 10% more of the general fund expenditures than higher education did. Given tepid economic growth, it seems likely that public universities will continue to struggle with funding issues and are likely to keep raising tuitions. According to Public Research Universities: Changes in State Funding, eleven states fell into this category. States have massive Medicaid and pension obligations that take up large amounts of the budget, and thanks to the Affordable Care Act and subsequent Medicaid expansion, those costs will continue to rise. It is unfortunate when a state feels it has to spend more on its correctional system than it does on its system for higher education. Overall, public university funding within state budgets has been cut by approximately 20% since 2008. The Obama administration recently suggested that reforming sentencing laws could realize an estimated $15 billion in savings and that the savings could be redirected toward schools. States are caught in a difficult position with respect to university funding.

2384,"Since Patriot Coal pays into a multi-employer pension plan administered by the UMWA, miners union President Cecil Roberts hopes that the other employers will be motivated to put legal pressure on Patriot Coal to maintain its contributions so they wont be stuck paying more. The miners union has filed suit claiming that Arch Coal and Peabody Energy designed Patriot Coal to failthen shifted over a billion dollars in pension and retiree health care debts to Patriot as a ploy to get out of those obligations. Indeed, last week in the St. Louis court where the Patriot case is being heard, mining company Murray Energy filed an objection to Patriots motion to dump its retiree obligations, stating that this would increase the liability that Murray Energy owes the UMWA plan. The UMWA fears if Peabody and Arch get away with spinning off their obligations to a company designed to collapse, more coal companies will take similar measures. Depending on a courts decision in the pending bankruptcy case of Patriot Coal, Bellas pension and retirement benefits could be wiped out, along with those of 20,000 other beneficiaries. Unlike the multi-employer pension plan, health care plans are individual to each employer, which means that unless the judge rules in the miners' favor, health care benefits will simply evaporate for all workers who retired after 1992 (under the COAL Act, the federal government covers health care for miners who retired before 1992). Senators and Unions Call for Obama to Intervene in Patriot Coal Bankruptcy.your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha UMWA members rallied in St. Louis on Jan. 29 to protest Patriot Coal's attempt in bankruptcy court to evade its obligations to retirees. The bill would make it tougher for coal companies to get out of obligations to retirees, extend retirement protections from the 1992 COAL Act to miners who retired after 1992, and transferred unused funds from the federal Abandoned Mine Land fund to shore up the insolvency. However, pensions for all coal miners could take a hit when the multi-employer plan comes up",1,1

Francis made another political point in his speech back in Lima later Friday to Kuczynski and other Peruvian authorities, denouncing corruption as a social virus that infects all aspects of life and must be combatted.

In his landmark 2015 encyclical, Praise Be, Francis demanded world leaders do more to protect what he called one of the lungs of Gods creation, and denounced the profit-at-all-cost business interests behind its steady demise.

5409,"On the surface it may not sound like a lot, but Social Security benefits provide at least half of all monthly income for 48% of married elderly couples, and 71% of unmarried elderly individuals rely on Social Security income for at least half of their monthly income. Despite having more than a dozen Social Security fixes to choose from, including multiple options to raise revenue through taxation, as well as reduce benefits, Congress hasn't made any progress on getting a solution implemented. If you're one of those aforementioned couples or individuals who's reliant on Social Security for at least half of your monthly income, or you're heading into retirement with very little in savings, this is a terrifying forecast. Furthermore, quite a few companies offer to match a percentage of their employees' annual income as both a loyalty incentive and an effort to get their employees on the right track to retirement. With Social Security's long-term outlook uncertain, and a cut of up to 21% looming by 2034, now more than ever millennials and Gen Xers need to find ways to broaden their income channels come retirement. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In the coming years we're going to see bonds yielding 3.5%+ maturing, leaving the Trust invested in special issue bonds with low yields that may not top the inflation rate. Being able to contribute so much annually can ensure you aren't too reliant on Social Security income during retirement. Low interest rates have had the opposite effect on people and funds looking to make money from fixed-income assets. The result is we have people living longer than ever, and able to draw Social Security payments for an extended period of time. The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

That the hack included terrorist threats and was focused on causing major corporate damage, rather than on stealing customer information for fraud like in the breaches at Home Depot and Target, indicates a whole new frontier has emerged in cybersecurity. While none of Weiner's clients have made large-scale changes to their security in reaction to the Sony attack specifically, cybersecurity is becoming a bigger focus in general. One example companies could follow is in the technology sector, where most firms have been tightening their security measures during the past 18 months in response to revelations about the digital spying tactics of the U.S. government.

While opening an IRA is a wise move by itself, you have the power to benefit even more from your account by maxing out annually, choosing a Roth, and finding cost-effective investments. Many folks who fund an IRA opt for the traditional version, since contributions are tax-deductible along the way.

Remember, the investments you choose for your IRA come at a cost, but index funds Opens a New Window.

If need be, you can access your principal contributions at any time (though it's generally not a good idea to tap a retirement plan early, since the more funds you remove, the less money you'll have available later on).

FactCheck Mailbag, Week of March 1-7.This week, readers continued to lambaste us over Social Security, and one sent a comment on New Jersey Gov. Based on your logic, it is just as correct to say that everyone who owns a Treasury bill is contributing to the deficit or that everyone who gets an income tax refund is contributing to the deficit. The other point some got wrong is the notion that the current problem is due to fiscally irresponsible spending in the past. It is not good policy for FactCheck to let these obvious corrective points be buried in your letters file. 2) The federal deficit began to balloon out of control by putting two senseless and hyper expensive wars on the national credit card and at the same time lowering taxes. But I can think, and I just cant accept your analysis of Social Security. This isnt a raid; did anyone really think they were going to put the money into a vault somewhere and sit on it?",0,0

""Recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to enforce age restrictions on the Internet, especially when parents want their children to access online content and services,"" Facebook told the paper. ""The idea that you would go after this segment of the audience when there are concerns about the current audience is mind boggling, James Styer, CEO of child-advocacy group Common Sense Media, told the Journal. These tools include ones that would link childrens account to their parents and give parents say over who their kids are friends with and what apps they use, the paper said. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is reportedly exploring mechanisms that would enable the social network to officially permit children under the age of 13 to become users, a move likely to raise the eyebrows of privacy advocates. By allowing kids on its site, Facebook could bolster its revenue prospects by expanding its user base beyond the current 900 million level. Concerned about these reports, Facebook believes it has little choice but to look at ways of formalizing their presence through controls, the Journal reported. We believe there is material risk that over the next 12 months, investors will question Facebook's ability to achieve our forecasted 2013 revenues as near-term revenue growth decelerates, Bernstein reportedly wrote, placing an underperform rating on the shares. However, privacy advocates already wary about Facebooks conduct are likely to express serious concern about such a move. The report comes in the wake of Facebooks controversial initial public offering, which raised $12 billion but failed to create a pop.

Powell looks far older, even if the coursing brilliance of the brisk bop he plays makes one think of the fountain of youth rather than of the grave. Even as he feasts on that bebop anthem Anthropology, a tune attributed to Parker and another of Powells fellow modern jazz pioneers, trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, the pianists razor sharp figurations have been blunted, the range of ideas shrunken, the mental invention thrumming in his head clearly outpacing the ability of his fingers to translate it instantaneously down at the ivories. Yet another refugee from American racism and cultural indifference, pianist Kenny Drew, Gordons frequent European collaborator in the years to come, was slated for the date, but when he couldnt make it, Powell was called upon. With his public appearances dwindling as a result of his deteriorating mental health, Powell moved to Paris in 1959 where over the next three years he lead a trio made up of another bop founding father, the drummer Kenny Clarke, and the Frenchman Pierre Michelot on bass. In spite of the gulf between past greatness and present decline that is so often stressed in Powells last years and premature death, there is an undeniable bravery and beauty those performances such as his Parisian Like Someone in Love that ennoble his late style come too soon. In the aftermath of this mighty improvisation, a landmark of jazz as export (and import back to the USA on the Blue Note vinyl), Powell seems barely able to make it through his two choruses.

With protesters calling for a general strike in Oakland on Wednesday, during which time they hope to shut down the citys port, all eyes will be watching Oaklands finest. The letter blames Mayor Jean Quan for ordering the clearing of the Occupy Oakland encampment that resulted in a young Iraq War veterans brain injury and national attention. In their letter to the residents of the city they are tasked to protect, the police officers say We, too, are the 99% fighting for better working conditions, fair treatment and the ability to provide a living for our children and families. As Reuters recalls, Oakland police officers have not always had the best relationship with the community. On Tuesday, October 25th, we were ordered by Mayor Quan to clear out the encampments at Frank Ogawa Plaza and to keep protesters out of the Plaza. Then, on Wednesday, October 26th, the Mayor allowed protesters back in to camp out at the very place they were evacuated from the day before.

GW Pharmaceuticals announced results from three different late-stage clinical studies that found Epidiolex helped reduce seizure frequency in patients with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), both of which are rare forms of epilepsy.While there's always a possibility that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could turn down approval of the drug, Epidiolex's chances appear to be pretty good. Combined, the two indications give GW Pharmaceuticals a market size of up to 23,500 patients in the U.S. alone.If we assume the price tag of Epidiolex is at the mid-point of the range expected by analysts, that's a potential annual market of over $1 billion. Is GW Pharmaceuticals still a good pick for investors -- or is this hot marijuana stock just too expensive to buy right now? If GW gets the payer coverage it expects, it seems likely that a large percentage of these patients will use Epidiolex for financial reasons. Advertisement The bigger concern is that GW Pharmaceuticals won't make enough revenue from Epidiolex to justify its current market cap of just under $3 billion. If GW Pharmaceuticals gets a thumbs-up from the FDA for Epidiolex for the indication, the company should have a solid case for convincing payers to cover the drug. Sativex, GW's first cannabinoid drug approved in 30 countries as a treatment for multiple sclerosis spasticity, hasn't been a huge financial winner so far. Assuming GW gains FDA approval for Epidiolex, the company should begin marketing the drug by summer of next year.

Through an extraordinary breadth of innovation, from arm braces that make human blockades impossible to dismantle to giant inflatables that can alter the media coverage of a struggle, Disobedient Objects argues that flashes of inspirational design have often made the difference in the success of a protest. Versions of the device were first designed in the late 1980s, allowing protesters to chain their arms to each other or around something in a way that the police could not safely dismantle. You get a lot of exhibitions that say: Designs that changed the world, said Gavin Grindon, one of the shows curators. Those conditions are about collective working about this kind of open source ethos and solidarity with other movements, so we did find that movements on the far right dont share those conditions, she said. Grindon told The Daily Beast the realization surprised him, but it seems the Left is more inventive, better at protesting. Walking through the show, its impossible to miss the trendvirtually all of the innovative, daring pieces of design and art have emerged from left-wing protest groups. The blow-up props were first used at a protest in Berlin in 2010, where the police and the media were warned in advance that violence was expected after previous events had been marred by cobbled paving stones thrown at police. If they throw it back, suddenly they are playing beach volleyball with anarchists, or they try and arrest it in which case they look completely absurd. Other exhibits worked more obliquely, altering the mood of a protest or changing the way a demonstration was later portrayed to the public. I think, by structure, those movements on the far-right arent about creating solidarity, aren't about creating new worlds. It was illegal to hold political protests in Poland in 1989, so 10,000 disaffected students got together in fancy dress.",1,1

I have heard they are building a State Veterans Home at Sparks, Kimball wrote in a July 5 letter to Nevada-based veterans officials. He lives in a California veterans home, but he wants to live in the Northern Nevada State Veterans Home.

That means setting up child care centers, mechanisms for helping those that rely on services that might not be available during the strike, devoting funds to support those that cannot afford to miss a day of work, and coordinating a public strategy to protect workers who may be disciplined or targeted for participating. These are what the Trump campaign has called the First Day Project, which Trump based on signing at least 25 executive orders that would seek to erase the Obama Presidency. It would not focus on any single cause or demand; instead, it would be a show of our collective power in opposition to Trumps extremism. If true resources and organization are put into the endeavor, and people go to work and continue shopping as if nothing has changed, then it will be a show of weakness on our part. Groups can engage in all other manner of resistance on Inauguration Day, from protests to sit-ins, but a general strike and protest can bring all these actions under one unified and powerful umbrella whose message cannot be misinterpreted. But well be in a better position to do so if we mobilize now to show politicians and corporations what is at stake if Trump follows his stated path, and show all participants what is possible in resisting. Many of these promises are executive actions that Trump will be able to enact without the cooperation of Congress. As protests against the election of Donald Trump continue, many have called on demonstrators to give the president-elect a chance, to wait and see what he does in office. Americans have an uncanny ability to get used to the extreme in short orderwe must take action before a sense of normalcy sets in.

Speaking recently from his South Side home, Murray explains that schools serving poor children need to tend to their emotional needs as well as their academic needs. The biggest thing that hurt my heart is that you would have these brilliant children who had so many issues to deal with that they didnt achieve their potential, Murray says.

My husband and I were in Ireland when word of America's latest mass shooting hit the European media and the story was the lead item on every news program. Our politicians give lip service to the idea of tougher gun laws, oblivious to the idea that the sick and the criminal aren't deterred by the myriad of laws already on the books. Identify mentally ill persons and make sure they are nowhere near a gun. Brendan Keenan of the Irish Independent pointed out that mass shootings happen so frequently in the United States that, ""A statistician could responsibly extrapolate how many more (shootings) to expect since they occur on such a regular basis."" About a month later, in September 2013, he passed a background check, bought a gun and killed 12 people inside the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. None of the government agencies ever reported Alexis to the federal database. Heartbreaking gun violence happens so often in America that it can now be accurately predicted. The New York Times reports that most recent mass shooters used legally purchased guns bought from licensed dealers, not from gun shows. Last October, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, used his father's Beretta to gun down four students inside his Marysville, Wash., high school cafeteria. Strengthen state mandatory hold laws for mentally ill people, not to punish but to provide genuine treatment.

If Gaume wanted, the state agency would be happy to run certain scenarios through the spreadsheet for Gaume, time permitting. The analysis by Gaume and his colleagues did not properly account for things like seepage from the reservoir site and evaporation that need to be taken into account before we have a clear understanding of the projects safe yield, Roepke said. When Gaume and his colleagues analyzed the spreadsheet, they concluded that the answer it provided was very different than the one the state had been sharing with the public. Proponents of the long-debated proposal say a diversion and reservoir would be a chance to use Gila water on farms and in cities in parched southwest New Mexico, water that would otherwise be lost downstream to Arizona. Gaume and Peter Coha, an engineer who helped with the analysis, argue that the average available water supply is a misleading measure, pulled up by a handful of extremely wet years when lots of water would be available. The retired engineer and former director of the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission wanted to know how much water would be available each year to divert from the Gila River for farm and city use in southwestern New Mexico. It was attached to a batch of electronic documents given to Gaume last summer improperly provided, in the words of Craig Roepke, the Interstate Stream Commission staffer overseeing the Gila project.

However, five hours or so after people were let back into the restrooms, more than 70 percent of the microbial colonies were associated with skin germs, not feces. The technology used at UNM uses chemicals that over time removes the film and allows disinfectants to kill microbes. Items like mop heads are also color-coded to eliminate cross contamination.

Researchers selected four restrooms in a science building San Diego State was one of the few schools that would allow access, and one of the researchers, Scott Kelley, is with the universitys department of biology.

(Even though, as I said, Sanders and Trump have introduced new models that could allow the sidestepping of single-issue lobbies like AIPAC). Of course there is also the issue of the pro-Israel vote in Florida and elsewhere, but they couldnt stop Trump in Florida or Pennsylvania so they are not as crucial as AIPAC keeps proclaiming. Indeed, if the occupied Palestinians end up living in the hell of a decades-long Apartheid under the Israeli jackboot, then Camp David looks more and more like just a separate peace in which Egypt extricated itself from further confrontations with expansionist Israel, receiving back the Sinai, and leaving the poor weak Palestinians and Lebanese to their oppressive fate. Each president behaves in this way because the Israel lobbies have traditionally helped fund political campaigns (John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt estimated that these lobbies provide as much as a third of the campaign funding for the Democratic Party.) So the danger is that if Obama lifts his standing veto on UNSC resolutions on the occupied Palestinian West Bank and Israeli colonization policy, single-issue pro-Israel lobbies will decline to support the Democratic Party in 2020. Washington has occasionally hosted Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but when the Israeli side insulted the US Secretary of State and the president and refused to cease aggressively colonizing Palestine even while they supposedly were parlaying over it, the US just acquiesced in Israeli intransigence. But this juncture is special, and Carter is right that Obama could take the lead here. Sanders could take a more even-handed stance on the occupation of the stateless Palestinians precisely because he did not owe any big donors anything. So this is the one time where Obama could probably cross the Likud Party without harming Democratic Party fundraising down the line. Trump would not easily be able",1,1

International experts in the emerging field of gene therapy said it would be hard to assess the results until the Oregon team fully published its findings. In December 2015, a group of international scientists and ethicists, including some from China, assembled by the US National Academy of Sciences said it would be irresponsible to use DNA editing tools to alter the genomes of human embryos, eggs, or sperm until safety, ethical and legal issues were resolved. Scientists in China were the first to carry out gene editing on human embryos in 2015, although with mixed results, the British journal Nature reported. Its very difficult to be able to comment on any specifics or the robustness of the science because there is no scientific paper, said Simon Waddington, Reader in Gene Transfer Technology at University College London. The MIT journal said the experiment appeared to show it was possible to safely and effectively use gene manipulation in embryos to treat hereditary illnesses.

Trump has delivered a wonderful Labor Day present to unemployed American millennials by ordering the end of former President Obamas unconstitutional issuing of work permits under the DACA amnesty. Trump administration rescinds DACA, gives Congress 6 months to act.WASHINGTON Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Tuesday that the Trump administration was rescinding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival program, or DACA, authorized in 2012 by an executive order by former President Barack Obama. Asked if Trump would sign or veto a stand-alone continuation of DACA without any sops to the right, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders responded that Trump is looking for responsible immigration reform. Trump stated that it is not his job to write laws as he tossed the hot potato back to Congress, which has voted on but never passed various versions of the DREAM Act, which would establish a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. President Donald Trump had vacillated on his promise to end DACA on day one of his presidency leading some DACA supporters to hope the policy would remain on the books. A Department of Justice press packet included testimony from George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, an Obama voter who agreed with many of the goals of the 2012 executive order creating DACA. In June, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, leader of a group that successfully blocked an Obama administration 2014 order to expand the protection to DACA participants family members, warned Sessions that he and other attorneys general would sue if the administration did not rescind DACA by Sept. 5. Sessions stated his belief that a lawsuit threatened by attorneys general from 10 states over the program was likely to prevail because the executive branch of the federal government under Obama deliberately sought to achieve what the legislative branch specifically refused to authorize on multiple occasions. Sessions said that acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke would conduct an orderly wind-down of the program, which has provided temporar",0,4
5037,"Few in America realizes how the Eastern Church, along with innocent Muslims, is under attack in Lebanon and Palestine by this rare alliance between Judaism and fundamentalist Christianity. All the while, Jews are familiar with historic betrayal at the hands of Christians who have found various ways to disguise their hatred of the so-called Christ-killers. There is nothing benign about their contemporary mistreatment at the hands of what they see as Western religion: Christianity with a fundamentalist jaundice, and Judaism colored by Zionist extremism. Victims of such attitudes today are vulnerable Christian minorities in Lebanon and Palestine, where entire societies are being attacked by Israel armed by the United States. Ive come to recognize something even more destructive common to almost all faith-based sects: the belief they are gods chosen people having a direct line to what god tells them (or that they tell him?) That does not make it easier for me to understand how avowed Christians from the U.S., with their Israeli allies, can today freely victimize Orthodox Christians as if they did not realize they exist in Islamic lands. The true tragedy is Israeli policy, approved if not fomented by the United States, that results in death for Lebanese and Palestinian civilians, and in retaliation, death for innocent Israelis. A New Kind of Bigotry.Ive not been a target of religious prejudice during my 73 years except today, as I identify with growing tragedy in the Middle East. On that day of rapture in the Christian lexicon, the church will offer Jews a choice. It has reached the point where the normally uninvolved Archbishop of Greeces Orthodox Church, Christodoulos, said in early August: Israels actions within its right to self-defense have long exceeded any rational limit. Myopia of the U.S., which identifies itself as Christian, is apparent in many Christians being killed, even if Americans callously assume targets are exclusively Muslim.

[10] We briefly pass over Mr. Hansons other non-sequiturs and illogicalities: his seeming dismissal of the Chinese contribution (the implication that the PRCs butchering its citizens after the war somehow negates the Chinese role in winning it) ignores the fact that the bulk of the Japanese Army was tied up in China throughout the war. For Hofstadters use of the phrase was intended to delineate precisely the kind of mentality that Mr. Hanson and his neoconservative confreres embody: the self-righteous, ignorance-is-strength 100-percent Americano who relentlessly conjures threats abroad, sniffs out subversion at home, and, in general, acts like a hybrid of Billy Sunday and General Jack D. Ripper. Perhaps Mr. Hanson can resolve this conundrum of who was loyal by paying a visit to the office of the senior Senator of Hawaii: Japanese-American, winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor, and infantry soldier who left a limb on the killing fields of World War II fighting for his country. To tap the last nail into the Mr. Hansons reputational sarcophagus, we cite a little-known but seminal work which demonstrates that victory in the Second World War was largely a matter of geology. How convenient when the invasion of Iraq (which Mr. Hanson fervently supports) has manifestly faltered and requires rhetorical support from an alleged man of learning, a species otherwise nowhere in evidence in the administrations camp. Or does Mr. Hansons reasoning run along the lines of, we were fully justified to imprison American citizens without due process as a wartime measure, and people shouldnt bring it up, but my political enemies ordered it, so I can have it both ways. For Mr. Hanson is one of a long and undistinguished line of personalities",1,1

After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, leaving thousands of poor African-American residents homeless and jobless, Bush promised bold action to confront poverty with roots in the history of racial discrimination. Healing the rift and bringing his party along will take more than words, particularly in advancing civil rights. In 2000, Bush promised to make civil rights enforcement a cornerstone of his administration. The departments civil rights division, for example, signed off on a Georgia voting plan and a Texas redistricting map that later were blocked by the courts for discrimination against minority voters. Admitting that his party hasnt exactly endeared itself to African Americans, he told his audience I want to change the relationship. He has done better than some critics contend, but no one could argue with a straight face that he kept that vow.

Although the defense wanted Singleton to step down after her telephone conversation with plaintiffs lawyer Sam Legate, the defense motion argues that, with her gone, a new trial is the appropriate remedy. Singleton wrote in the email that she gave him two names and then she told Legate he might want to research harmless error and asked if Plaintiffs meant to raise this as an issue.

(Los Angeles residents will be voting on two housing initiatives this November one that would raise property taxes to fund housing for the chronically homeless, and another that would require large housing developments to set aside a portion of units for low-income residents.) In addition to pushing for bond and loan referendums that would create new financing for these ends in pricey areas like San Francisco and Oakland, community activists are confronting a deepening housing crisis in Baltimore, a city thats often overlooked in discussions of affordability. Baltimore residents will have the opportunity to vote on a ballot initiative that would amend the citys charter to create an affordable housing trust fund an entity to provide housing assistance for families making 50 percent or less than the area median income. Ott calls for creating a program that allows middle-income affordable rental housing to coexist with homeowner-occupied homes, as well as diverting more resources from subsidized downtown developments to neglected, poor neighborhoods (something United Workers also supports). A national survey released by Ipsos Public Affairs in July found that six in 10 Americans say its a key issue for them, and nearly sixty percent of respondents say their local officials are not doing enough to improve housing affordability. Faced with rising housing costs, at least twelve cities will be voting on affordable housing ballot initiatives come Election Day with most of them revolving around constructing more affordable units and providing more support for the homeless. For the 34 percent of Baltimore renters who live below the poverty line, the challenge of finding affordable units on the private market has grown increasingly difficultnot to mention that the majority of poor renters in Baltimore receive no housing subsidies from the government.

The BBS activists take strong exception to the notion that they are paranoid left-wingers who would rather strike than write. This may come as no big surprise to people who watch TV or go to movies, but some of the best writing done by members of the Writers Guild of America is never aired in publicnor is it meant to be.

That is, they did until this past April, when three BBS activists filed a free-speech suit against the guild for making them sign loyalty oaths to use the BBS. Instead of attacking Walton, says one former board member, activists should be lighting candles in his honor: He brought the union back from the brink of disintegration and saved it from total collapse. In response, the guilds board of directors summarily shut down the BBS for being excessively contentious, a potential legal liability, and generally more trouble than it was worth.

Iraq has had a string of little successes such as the downing of a helicopter, the capture of US ground troops, and there has been no uprising of Kurds and Shia Muslims as there was after the Gulf War. War is slowly coming to northern Iraq and is likely to be hastened by the setbacks to the US-led coalition in the south of the country. This would help the Kurds to return to the provinces of Kirkuk and Mosul, from which 300,000 of them were ethnically cleansed by President Saddam, and give them a strong hand to play in post-war settlement. But the sudden appearance of General Osman at a press conference in the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party in Salahudin yesterday marked an escalation of US involvement in northern Iraq. Even in Kurdistan, where the US is popular and where President Saddam committed some of his worst atrocities, there are flickers of Iraqi patriotism.

Instead, Republicans are split into three camps on spending: defense hawks who want even more money for the military than proposed by Trump; pragmatists who are defenders of domestic programs; and conservatives who agree with Trumps plan to cut domestic agencies and deliver the proceeds to the Pentagon. The Bipartisan Policy Center says that revenue results from this months quarterly tax payments could clarify the deadline, but for now it forecasts that Mnuchin has sufficient maneuvering room to keep the government solvent into the fall. Lawmakers are trying to deal with the debt limit while at the same time a House panel is beginning work on spending bills to fund the government. Republicans, who control Congress and the White House, are struggling to come up with a strategy to raise the debt limit, with some GOP members demanding spending cuts in exchange for their vote. Shortly before Mnuchin testified, a Washington think tank projected that despite the slowdown in revenues, the government will have enough cash to pay its bills until October or November. Republicans are still struggling to come up with a broader budget that would dictate spending levels for other agencies.

5686,"The donor letter makes a political case in addition to an economic one, arguing that blocking action would risk a long-lasting perception that Republicans would rather see nothing done than pass needed reform. Another signer, Carlos Gutierrez, former commerce secretary and a leader of the group Republicans for Immigration Reform, said that hes seen some donor fatigue as his group tries to raise money to fight for overhauling immigration but that it would aim to spend enough to sway 12 to 15 congressional districts. I believe if we come up with a pathway to good legal immigration, part of that does mean citizenship, but lets take things one step at a time. Both sought to frame the immigration debate partly in economic terms that could sway majority House Republicans, who are debating how to move forward with immigration legislation after the Senate passed a comprehensive bill in June with visa reforms, border security and eventual citizenship for the 11 million immigrants already in the country illegally. One signer of the letter, Spencer Zwick, former national finance chairman for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, said that broader language was used to draw as much donor support as possible. The potential for the House to reach any agreement with the Senate on a final package that could reach President Barack Obamas desk is very much in doubt. No action is expected in the House until fall, at which point Republicans may advance a piecemeal series of single-issue bills beginning with border security. The letter does not set out specific policies the groups are seeking but argues that the existing immigration system is completely incapable of responding to the national economy or global competition and says that failure to act is not an option. I think what you want to do with a letter like that is be careful not to let one line destroy the letter, Zwick said. The letter calls for a path to legal status for immigrants here illegally, stopping short of calling for citizenship. I dont think were going to be doing national TV campaigns, which can be so expensive, but were going to be able to make a difference in local districts where it counts, Gutierrez said.

Of all ACT-tested high school graduates this year, 64 percent met the English benchmark of 18 points that predicts success in a composition course. The ACT report is based on the 54 percent of high school graduates this year who took the exams. Just a quarter of this years high school graduates cleared the bar in all four subjects, demonstrating the skills theyll need for college or a career, according to company data. Of the 1.7 million students who took the 215-question ACT exam, as many as 290,000 were within 2 points of meeting at least one of the four readiness thresholds. ADVERTISEMENT The ACT reported that 31 percent of all high school graduates tested were not ready for any college coursework requiring English, science, math or reading skills. ACT compared federal Bureau of Labor Statistics projections with their own questionnaires and found insufficient student interest in the five fastest-growing industries with workers who require some college. For instance, the government estimates that 17 percent of job openings in 2020 will be in education fields but only 6 percent of test takers told ACT they wanted a job there. Only 26 percent of students met the benchmarks for all four sections of the ACT test. Company officials attribute the slide to updated standards and more students taking the exams including many with no intention of attending two- or four-year colleges. Computer and information technologies will account for 11 percent of openings in 2020, but only 2 percent of students indicated they want a career in that industry.

In 2011, despite the Food and Drug Administrations determination that Plan B is safe for all ages, the Department of Health and Human Services decided to block teenagers from buying the drug without a prescription. These emergency contraceptives would be among the safest drugs sold over-the-counter, the number of 11-year-olds using these drugs is likely to be miniscule, the FDA permits drugs that it has found to be unsafe for the pediatric population to be sold over-the-counter subject only to labeling restrictions, and its point-of-sale restriction on this safe drug is likewise inconsistent with its policy and the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as it has been construed. President Barack Obama endorsed HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decision, arguing that the government could not be confident that a 10-year-old or an 11-year-old going into a drugstore should be ablealongside bubble gum or batteriesbe able to buy a medication that potentially, if not used properly, could end up having an adverse effect.

Northup and other reproductive rights group argued that the age limits harmed teenagers who required timely access to the drug, which is supposed to be used within 72 hours of unprotected sex.

Another possible problem in Turkeys view is that the NATO missile defense shield would share information with Israel, a plan with which Turkey is apparently not comfortable.#160; Even though Turkey has been assured that the data collected by early warning NATO systems in Turkey would not be shared with Israel, Turkey appears to remain apprehensive. After the Lisbon Summit of 2010, however, in a decision that attracted a lot of criticism against Turkey from Iran, it was decided that Turkey would host the earlywarning radar systems as a component of a missile defense shield. In 2009, existential missile threats from Israel or even Syria resulted in Turkey desiring four long-range missile defense systems capable of destroying incoming missiles before they could enter Turkish airspace. It is too early to predict if a Chinese missile defense system in Turkey could jeopardize Turkeys relations with its NATO allies. This decision however, was not viewed in positive light by NATO and the U.S. As Turkey is a member of NATO, to ensure that the EPAA will be able to provide blanket protection to Europe from ballistic missile threats, all missile defense systems of member nations need to be compatible with each other. Even though, at Turkeys request, NATO Patriot interceptors were deployed in Turkey to counter Syrian missiles, Turkey opened its bidding to Russia, China, France and the U.S. for missile defense interceptors. Turkey Plans to Buy Missile Defense System–But Not from NATO.By turning to Russia and China for a missile defense system, Turkey could be jeopardizing relations with its NATO allies. In April 2015, Turkey struck a strategic industrial alliance with Ukraine that would include cooperation in the field of development of missile defense system.

Calling for the protection of Tunisia's ""Arab and Islamic identity,"" a new parliamentary system, and access to healthcare and infrastructure in the rural areas - in a way that resonates with unemployed young people here - Ennahda is polling at around 30 percent ahead of elections. Boukaaba said PDM's number one priority was to ensure the constitution separated Islam and the state, but could not name her party's second most important issue. ""We didn't concentrate on sending our message to the media, but concentrated on sending it the people,"" said one Ennahda volunteer, who did not give his name, at the party headquarters in the poor western governorate of El Kef on the Algerian border. While its widespread support has rattled some of Tunisia's more secular citizens, who fear it will roll back the rights of women, the Islamists are commanding respect for their sacrifices under the Ben Ali regime. When PDP's youth liaison, Foued Ben Arar, and PDM candidate Mounia Boukaaba, were asked together how they would each approach a specific economic or social problem in Tunisia, they said they ""did not know,"" because they had ""never been in power.""

But Lisa Rosenberg, executive director of Open the Government, a coalition of good-government and watchdog groups, says the the rules are clear: Under the Presidential Records Act, recordings between the president and a senior government official that occur in the White House are not private recordings; they are presidential records that will eventually be released to the public. Given the current circumstances, the destruction of such tapes would raise serious obstruction of justice issues, Eisen says. Not only was this a loosely veiled threat directed at the former FBI director, whom Trump unceremoniously fired on Tuesday, but it also suggested that Trump possessed recordings of their conversationsperhaps even a tape of their January 27 dinner, where the president claims Comey told him he was not under investigation as part of the bureaus probe of the Trump campaigns Russia ties. Unfortunately, Rosenberg says, there is no real mechanism to ensure the White House is preserving the tapes as records for future release. The good news for historians is that if such tapes do exist, the Trump administration is required by law to preserve these presidential records and turn them over to the National Archives and Records Administration.

1686,"While it has regained all that lost ground, and more, over the past month, it's worth a look at why Wynn's new casino got off to a slow start whileLas Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS), which also opened a new resort on the strip, was able to beat estimates and show much-stronger results. All-new venues, lots more hotel space, and a gaming market just trying to regain its footing may prove challenging to Wynn Resorts. The opening of the new Wynn Palace in Macau is credited with halting the two-year slide in the region's gaming revenues, but it couldn't maintain the momentum. While many of the problems it faces are correctable, having to go in and remodel a brand new resort it just opened already puts it behind its rivals and indicates a rare miscalculation for Wynn Resorts. However, a Wells Fargo analyst estimates promotional allowances and discounts as a percentage of gross gaming revenue ran as high as 30.4% at Wynn due to opening the Palace, well above the company's usual 24%, though he's not necessarily worried at the moment. VIP business returned to Macau much more strongly than anticipated in November, and the analyst thinks that could have tilted the discounting scales in the new resort's favor. Better-situated competition:While the Palace may find its location on the light-rail line advantageous in the future, the casino is otherwise situated a good distance from the strip itself, which tourists may find off-putting (VIPs, on the other hand, if they really are back, might enjoy being out of the limelight more). Most notably, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN) missed Wall Street forecasts for its new Palace resort on Macau's Cotai Strip, causing its stock to plunge after the news. On the earnings conference call with analysts, CEO Steve Wynn said it was ""an anomalous situation where all four sides of our property are currently being enclosed by either barricades or construction blockades of one kind or another.""

If the anti-Trump movement continues to follow the trajectory of Occupy all march and no action we might have already seen the high water mark.

This sentiment is likely worrying millions of people, who see hope in the anti-Trump movement but fear its disintegration.

When the war began there was not the slightest doubt anywhere on the political spectrum, from the ecological-fundamentalist wing of the Greens to the higher echelons of the CDU (Christian Democrats), that Germany should opt out of the conflict militarily and play a subordinate role financially.

11075,"Like Tebow, Lin has spoken of relying on faith to help carry him through the highs and lows of his sports career, and both men often praise God during post-game interviews. Still, as one of the very few Asian-Americans to ever reach the NBA, Lin will have millions following his every move, said Melanie Mar Chow of the Asian-American Christian Fellowship campus ministry. I think the things he says in interviews, his approach to the game is just unbelievable and I respect him so much, Lin recently told a California radio station. Lins passing reference to Romans 8:28 was caught by his longtime pastor, Stephen Chen of Redeemer Bible Fellowship, a ministry within the Chinese Church in Christ in Mountain View, Calif. Chen describes the church as full of first- and second-generation immigrants, like Lin and his parents, who are conservative in nature and evangelical in faith. Lin himself has called Tebow a polarizing figure, but also said that he draws inspiration from the young quarterbacks example. Like any good point guard, Lin knows the art of the pass distributing the praise to his teammates and to God. Tom Krattenmaker, author of the book Onward Christian Athletes, is among the many who see some similarities between Lin and Tebow. Even during basketball season, when games went deep into Saturday night, Lins family made sure he was in the pews on Sunday morning, Chen said. As his star rose, first at Harvard and then with the NBAs Golden State Warriors, Lin shared his faith testimony with youth groups and churches near his California home. Chen, who said he recently spoke to Lin, expects his sharp-shooting congregant to continue his evangelism in the bright lights of the Big Apple. But while Lin and Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow share similar Christian convictions, Lins rise to stardom is even more miraculous. The Knicks have promptly won five straight games, with their new point guard leading the way, sending the New Yorkers and Asian-Americans across the country into a frenzy of Linsanity.",0,2

The administration also made what has been described as a ransom, another cash payment of $400 million to Iran concurrently with the release of four American hostages.

ARK Mother Jones: After Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley announced hefty profits last fall, the Obama administrations pay czar said that hed cap pay at Citigroup, Bank of America, and five other bailed-out companies. The move was largely symbolic: It capped salaries for only 25 executives, kept big stock bonuses in place, and did nothing to address the culture of rewarding folks who sowed our economic destruction.

6780,"The 24-year old Bundy (13-8), who came back off the bereavement list for this game, combined with catcher Welington Castillo in mixing pitches and speeds, relying on a good slider plus a strong fastball and changeup and allowed only a fourth-inning bunt single from Kyle Seager. Bundy threw a complete-game one-hitter and struck out a career-high 12 batters, and Manny Machado led a four-homer attack with two solo shots as the Orioles extended their winning streak to six games with a 4-0 victory over the Mariners. Bundy retired seven in a row early in the game and, after giving up the Seager single in the fourth, set down the next 12 Mariners until Guillermo Heredia reached on shortstop Tim Beckhams second throwing error of the night. The Baltimore Orioles starter used all of his pitches, changed speeds, and the Mariners could manage nothing more than one bunt single early in the game. His work was even more impressive considering the fact that the right-hander lost a family member in recent days and needed to bounce back from that and had to battle through a 32-minute rain delay at the start. Yeah, I just threw the curveball a couple times, but mainly it was fastball, slider, change back there, Bundy said.

3181,"Although human rights groups suggest World Bank and IFC officials have lost their moral compass in Honduras and other developing countries, insiders say the issue is more complicated because its far from clear what actions to take in corrupt societies. Although Facusse says hes committed to the communitys welfare, human rights groups accuse the 89-year-old and his security forces of possible crimes against humanity related to the killing, kidnapping and forced eviction of farmers in one of Central Americas bloodiest recent agricultural conflicts. In December 2010, the IFC urged Facusse to use restraint after the Washington-based group Rights Action sent a letter to the World Bank calling the situation a human rights disaster and accusing the financial institution of gross negligence. The audit has been in the works since April 2012, when the World Banks internal watchdog, the Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, said it would look into whether the IFCs funding had negative social or environmental impacts on and around Dinants plantations. The resulting inquiry revealed the IFC was involved in an elaborate funding program that kept millions pouring into Dinant even after the bank registered concerns about the violent land conflicts. But Rights Action co-director Annie Bird who wrote the original report raising concerns to the World Bank says landowners private security forces, military and police on Hondurass Caribbean coast have completely militarized the area where Dinant operates. Now a senior fellow at Georgetown Universitys Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs, Marshall says international finance groups must weigh the costs and benefits of taking on each client. Katherine Marshall, who worked on international development for the World Bank for 35 years, says it operates on the assumption that its possible to make changes from within institutions. Human rights groups accuse the IFC of ignoring warnings that its funding for the Honduran palm oil industry is helping fuel a deadly land conflict thats turning the fertile Aguan Valley near the countrys northern coast into a virtual military zone.

Approaching the 2016 election year, Republicans would be happy to push bills through Congress highlighting GOP priorities if they can, even though Obama wouldn't let them become law. And the Treasury Department was given authority to borrow money until March 2017 - avoiding a first-ever federal default next week, which economists warn could badly wound the economy. Lawmakers still must approve additional legislation by Dec. 11 detailing how much money each agency will get, and for which programs. Its contents are modest, falling shy of the bigger spending boosts Democrats would love to win and lacking far larger savings Republicans would love to wring from giant entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Most importantly, the extra dollars make it likely Congress will fund the government after Dec. 11, when agencies otherwise would run out of money and would have to close. That includes language to block federal funds for Planned Parenthood, curb enforcement of clean air and water rules, hinder Obama's efforts to expand trade with Cuba, undo controls over financial institutions enacted after the Great Recession and undermine the president's health care overhaul.

13355,"From Caldwells introduction to the new Army manual: the greatest threat to our national security comes not in the form of terrorism or ambitious powers, but from fragile states either unable or unwilling to provide for the most basic needs of their people. The manual follows two earlier documents issued in 2005 ( National Security Directive 44 and Department of Defense Directive 3000.05), which first paid institutional attention to the need to adjust the militarys approach to 21st century conflictsboth issued amid widespread criticism that the Bush administration did not adequately prepare for its occupation of Iraq. As Caldwell explained to the Washington Post, the importance of what comes after the Armys traditional bailiwick of killing people and breaking things has been weighing on his mind for some time. But the new Army field manual solidifies these earlier orders and will shape how GIs are deployed for years to come. His predecessor was none other than David Petraeus, who authored the Armys new counter-insurgency manual and went on to implement it in Iraq. Today, the U.S. Army released its Stability Operations Field Manual (.pdf), which places humanitarian and relief work at the center of its strategic focus. Achieving victory will assume new dimensions as we strengthen our ability to generate soft power to promote participation in government, spur economic development, and address the root causes of conflict among the disenfranchised populations of the world. Instead, we will work through and with the community of nations to defeat insurgency, assist fragile states, and provide vital humanitarian aid to the suffering. To confront the challenges before us, we must strengthen the capacity of the other elements of national power, leveraging the full potential of our interagency partners. At the heart of this effort is a comprehensive approach to stability operations that integrates the tools of statecraft with our military forces, international partners, humanitarian organizations, and the private sector. Americas future abroad is unlikely to resemble Afghanistan or Iraq, where we grapple with the burden of nation-building under fire. New Army Doctrine Emphasizes “Stability Operations”.",1,1

At a time of high unemployment, the teachers and the Chicago Teachers Union want a pay increase and better medical coverage, as well as provisions that include a hire-back policy for laid-off teachers and one that makes it more difficult to dismiss underperforming teachers. The public school system is a virtual state monopoly inundated by many dictates from Washington and has been unable to consistently produce nearly enough well-rounded graduates capable of supporting themselves or contributing to the nation. Chicago public school teachers who went on strike Monday have struck against the public interest, placing self-interest in difficult economic times ahead of children. As World Magazine recently reported, About 300 private, largely Christian schools in the state are accepting voucher students and gaining a financial boost as they arrive. Yet public school students, especially the poor and minorities, remain locked in failed schools so that Democratic politicians can seemingly reap the political benefits and contributions from teachers unions. For eight years, this scholarship program has empowered low-income parents to choose the best learning environment for their children, Boehner said in June. The president doesnt believe that vouchers are a long-term answer to our educational problems and the challenges that face our public school system, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs offered in 2009. Thousands of families have taken advantage of this scholarship program to give their children an opportunity to succeed in life, and theres strong evidence that its both effective and cost-effective. But the state, like most of the nation, is spending record amounts on public schools.

Spoiler Alert: According to the good conduct guide, sexual harassment has no place in the parliament. A special external body will be established to combat sexual harassment in the Swiss parliament following the scandal. Last week, a prominent Swiss MP, Yannick Buttet, was forced to resign as vice president of the Christian-Democrat Party after Le Temps newspaper reported that a police complaint was filed against the politician by his ex-lover following allegations of stalking.#160; There have also been allegations of inappropriate behavior towards other women, the newspaper reported, citing multiple anonymous sources.

1040,"Siobhan Gorman of The National Journal writes that one big lesson from the controversy over the 9/11 footage in President Bushs first 2004 campaign ads is: looking backward tends to be more fraught with political peril than looking ahead. As Gallup states: Unless the issue of terrorism grows more important in the minds of voters by Election Day than it is today a distinct possibility if terrorist events like the one in Madrid, Spain on 3/11 are repeated elsewhere President George W. Bushs solid reputation with the public for handling terrorism may not be enough to secure his reelection. Families of those involved in the attacks criticized Bush for crassly taking advantage of their loss for his political gain and John Zogby said Republicans 9/11-centric strategy was designed with a 75 percent-approval president in mind not for one whose standing has eroded. Team Bush is obviously trying to keep the campaign focused on their issue, terror and national security, but, as of right now, Americans seem to have different priorities. Bush strategists even admitted they invented the issue assuming that raising taxes to that extent would be the only way Kerry could cover the costs of his proposed health plan. Kerry can only afford one-third of Bushs media buy, and instead hopes to rely on other political groups to run ads, like moveon.org, who arent legally allowed to communicate with the campaign. Unfortunately for the Democrats, Kerrys paper trail in the Senate could provide even more ammunition, with plenty of votes which seem more than questionable when stripped of their political nuance and context. Americans are just beginning to develop an image of Kerry, so slapping a few derogatory keywords on him (and then reinforcing those over and over and over again) could be a good strategy for Bush. In fact, the Bush campaign has already run into trouble with one of their ads that featured 9/11 footage. The GOP is using Kerrys long Senate record to drive home an image of Kerry (as they say in the most recent ad) as wrong on defense and not a decisive leader. Jamieson also points to the fact that, since 9/11, more Americans pay closer attention",1,1

6323,"With more information circulating on social networks, and increasing awareness of the countrys pesticide abuse problem, organic farmers markets like the one in Vila Velha are on their way to becoming fixture in many Brazilian cities. One of the reasons that many concerned Brazilians are switching to organic is that the country is also the biggest user of pesticides per capita in the world, an unfortunate distinction Brazil has held since 2008. Another factor that boosted the use of pesticides in Brazil was an outdated and loose regulation that was in place until 1989, which made it easier to register hundreds of toxic substances, some of which had already been banned in developed countries, said Veiga. Rising demand is likely to boost the share of organic food in Brazils agricultural production which currently stands at only five percent of the total and hopefully slows down the poisoning of the country with pesticides. Poison-friendly Policies According to Moyses Veiga, an environmental consultant who has lived among the Pomeranians and worked for the Cho Vivo organic certification scheme, the deeper story dates back to the 1960s when different governments started to pursue a policy of modernizing agriculture. Then, some years ago, a high suicide rate in the community called the attention of researchers, who established a link between the deaths and the high use of pesticides in the region many of which also caused infertility and skin cancer. Due to a high concentration of this class of chemicals in the waterways of Mato Grosso State, where some of Brazils largest monocultures are located, post-graduate student Izabela Gutierrez de Arruda felt compelled to look deeper into their effects. And besides the amount of pesticides, the situation is exacerbated by the fact that chemicals which have been banned in most other countries get dumped in Brazil due to lax legislation and intense lobbying from chemical companies. According to Srgio Koiffman, a researcher with Fundao Oswaldo Cruz, pesticides are substances designed to destroy certain animal pests whose structure is similar to our own.

11756,"Under the headline Bailout Helps Fuel a New Era of Wall Street Wealth, Times reporter Graham Bowley detailed many of the enabling favors that the government, under two presidents, extended to Goldman, like clearing the way for the company to issue bonds guaranteed by the FDIC. Many of the steps that policy makers took last year to stabilize the financial systemreducing interest rates to near zero, bolstering big banks with taxpayer money, guaranteeing billions of dollars of financial institution debtshelped set the stage for this new era of Wall Street wealth. Nor will it shock the lobbyists for Wall Street augmented, as The Nation reported last week, by the pro-Goldman efforts of former Democratic congressman and faux populist Dick Gephardt that the rich will emerge richer from this deep recession in which so many Americans have lost everything. The people I want to know more about are the superrich who expect to be rewarded for their failures, like the folks at Goldman Sachs who will receive $16.71 billion in bonuses an average of $530,000 per employee this year after their company did as much as any to bring the world economy to the brink of disaster. But even so, it was enough to push aside most consideration of the true hoax reported last week with far less fervor: the obscene rewards that Wall Street bankers bestowed upon themselves for ripping off our economy. It should not come as a surprise to Timothy Geithner, who, as The Wall Street Journal reported last week, talks to the honchos of Goldman more often than to members of Congress ostensibly in charge of banking legislation. The additional cool $12.9 billion that Goldman received from the government as a pass-through from the bailout of AIG to cover Goldmans toxic paper is money the investment bank has no intention of ever paying back. Why wasnt there a CNN stakeout at the homes of former Goldman-execs-turned-treasury-chiefs Robert Rubin and Henry Paulson aimed at finding out how they feel about the almost $7 billion profit that Goldman Sachs made in the last two quarters in the wake of the governments bailout of the firm?

We've got a few different categories that we're going to look at when it comes to determining whether that stock is a ""never-sell stock,"" and the first aspect we're going to look at is company culture.

Moser: I do think that's an important thing to note, and so when we say ""never sell stocks"" I think that's a little bit of hyperbole in that we really do focus on longer-term investing than most do. Moser: What you want to make sure you have is a business that is not going to be beholden to the capital markets in order to do its thing for long, sustained periods of time. It has done great for me, and I feel like Howard Schultz is the type of leader who will never let me down over the long term. Moser: I think a lot of people do, too, when it comes to valuation because it seems like it's the boring part of investing. I think given its assets, given its management team, and a relatively attractive stock price, I would be very hard-pressed to sell this one ever.

11236,"Levitt was unable to see the true correlation between abortion and crime because he was among the first victims of an epic change in the teaching of economics orchestrated by Stigler, with Beckers support. But once a media maelstrom erupted over the books assertion that legalized abortion has led to a reduction in crime, Levitt was forced to buttress the argument with his authority, telling the New York Times, for example, As an economist, I am better than the typical person at figuring out whether abortion reduces crime. Economics has been taught at the highest university level since about 1250, when Thomas Aquinas integrated four theories from Aristotle and Augustine into a coherent whole: production; utility, which explains consumption; exchange; and final distribution, which explains personal gifts and crimes (as well as distributive justice in the family and government). Stiglers 1983 Nobel address advised his peers to consider themselves so many used-theory salesmen, whose livelihood was mortally threatened by students knowledge that newer (or older) theories are superior: Gary Becker has suggested thatthe established scholar possesses a valuable capital asset in his command over a particular body of knowledge. This will be true in coming decades as economists who understand the human approach to economic behavior of Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas find full employment rewriting neoclassical theories of the Bentham-Becker variety. As far back as data exist, rates of economic fatherhood and homicide have been strongly, inversely cointegrated a stringent statistical test characterizing inherently related events, like the number of cars entering and leaving the Lincoln Tunnel. One can see this in a comparison of homicide rates and economic fatherhood, the latter defined by the Total Fertility Rate for the same demographic mix as prisoners (though measured for women, its almost exactly the same for men) minus men in prison (who cannot provide for children) and children on welfare (who arent supported by fathers). This is why Levitt couldnt reach a statistically valid conclusion about abortion and crime: he was trying to explain four things with only three explanatory equations.

In North Carolina, only Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which controls about 80 percent of the states market for individual and small-business policies, offered to renew plans covering 474,000 people that had been slated for cancellation.

Rather than providing money to teachers at the beginning of their schooling and taking a chance that the investment will pay off, loan repayment programs like the one Stapleton proposes would help teachers who have already completed their teaching degrees. This year, Stapleton sponsored House Bill 53, which would help pay off student loans for teachers who go to work in schools where many students come from low-income families or where few students score proficiently on state tests. The report cites a 2008 LFC finding that loan repayment programs, like the one Stapleton is proposing, are more cost-effective than loan for service programs like the one currently in place. Stapleton said Martinez vetoed the bill two years ago citing fiscal concerns and that this iteration of the bill will not change tax rates or create any new financial burden. Stapleton said the current fund is underused, and her program would be more efficient and effective. Stapleton said some of her constituents who are teachers have consistently asked her to carry the legislation and she believes it would give teachers a reason to teach where they are most needed. The purpose of this program is to create an incentive for licensed teachers to select teaching positions in high-risk schools, she said. ADVERTISEMENT There is evidence to support this in the fiscal impact report on the bill, prepared by staff of the Legislative Finance Committee. Such programs also create less financial risk for the state, according to the report. Susana Martinez vetoed in the bill in 2011 and Rep. Sheryl Williams Stapleton, D-Albuquerque, who sponsored the bill both times, is hoping for a different outcome this year. Martinez spokesman Enrique Knell said in an email Monday that the bill is still under review.",0,0

He made the absurd claim that Labor Day differs essentially from some of the other holidays of the year in that it glorifies no armed conflicts or battles of mans prowess over man, and wrote scathingly about the dark side of the labor movement represented by the Pullman strikers. Tracing Labor Days conservative roots, were reminded that the holiday was established in 1894, by President Grover Cleveland as a way to de-escalate class tension following the Pullman Strike, during which as many as ninety workers were gunned down by thousands of US Marshals serving at the pleasure of railway tycoon George Pullman, one of the times most hated industrial barons. The Pullman Strike was one of the most catalyzing moments in American history, leading working people all over the country to draw revolutionary conclusions including Debs, who read Marx for the first time while imprisoned for his role in organizing the strike. Although previous Septembers had seen small workers celebrations in many states observing the end of summer, the first federally protected Labor Day was marked in 1894 with an AFL-supported parade. Though its a welcome break from work for many of us, Labor Day is just another legacy of worker defeat. Walters explains: In an impressive display of working-class solidarity, more than 150,000 railroad workers in 27 states joined the strike in the weeks that followed, refusing to switch, signal, or service trains pulling Pullman cars. May Day celebrates the historic power of the working class to oppose its oppression and fundamentally alter society. Gompers later wrote a superlative column in the New York Times praising Labor Day as the harbinger of a new epoch in the annals of human history. He signed Labor Day into law a mere six days after busting the strike. President Cleveland",1,1

Yet, when Schwarzenegger refused to sign the budget on the grounds that it didnt go far enough in cutting welfare programs, the Democrats responded that Schwarzeneggers proposed budget (which is admittedly harsher on schools) would ruin the basic functions of Californias government and intensify the states economic troubles. Terminating the Budget Crisis.In a move that smells strongly of the old strength and decisiveness that brought him into office, Governor Schwarzenegger has rejected the most recent Democratic budget plan as being insufficiently concerned with cutting the right programs and with raising the right taxes, according to the Los Angeles Times.This rejection comes on the heels of a bit of truly dirty political maneuvering, in which the Democrats managed to squeeze $9.3 million in taxes out of Californias wallets without so much as consulting a single GOP assemblyman or senator. Funny how that works, since it is precisely the Democratic ideology (and Schwarzeneggers up-to-this-point nonstop record of appeasement) that has put California in budget shortfall. Very well, but if schools are such a basic function, one wonders why the Democrats would include them in their budget rather than cutting programs like the state workforce and welfare programs at all. Schwarzenegger, having just taken a truly principled stand against one bit of Democratic cynicism, ought to now take the required steps to bring this flatly anti-representative bit of tax-and-spend zealotry to heel. Considering that according to Schwarzenegger, Cedillos pet issue, drivers licenses for illegal immigrants, would cost the state millions of dollars, Cedillo really ought to be more careful before ranting about the responsibility of cutting the budget.

House Democrats offer to negotiate on Confederate flag in return for Voting Rights Act update: House Republican leadership is still struggling to find a way out of the hole they dug for themselves in last week's Confederate flag debacle, and Democrats are offering them an out. Rep. James Clyburn (S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat, said Thursday that Democratic leaders will drop their push to attach flag-related amendments to appropriations bills, freeing Republicans to pursue their spending agenda, if GOP leaders will agree to consider an update to the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a central part of which was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013.

In order to better protect their financial security, investors choosing to work with a robo-advisor should look for a robo-advisor that offers at least one of these features: Another related concern that has been raised by regulators is whether the portfolios being recommended by robo-advisors are too inconsistent and therefore potentially too aggressive for some investors, with too much exposure to stocks and other riskier investments. The robo advisors' single-strategy approach to wealth management, combined with the fact that they have no proven track record in bear markets or significant market corrections, leads to the yet-unanswered question: How will robo advisors perform under adverse stock market and/or economic conditions? However, the limited nature of the services that robo-advisors provide has raised concerns among regulators that robo-advisor customers may not understand the potential consequences of such limitations, specifically any investment risks and potential financial losses. Where traditional investment advisors may offer a range of asset management services, robo-advisors typically only offer a much limited range of services on the accounts they manage. The original purpose of robo-advisors was to provide affordable account-management services for ordinary investors, who often cannot meet the minimum account requirements of traditional investment advisors -- or pay their hefty fees. These low fees give robo-advisors a considerable edge -- yet investors could find that the lack of human oversight leaves their portfolio at risk of serious losses. Robo-advisors do provide a meaningful service to investors who want help managing their portfolios but can't (or don't want to) pay the price for a traditional advisor.

From the very day of their arrest the case of the three was a political totem whose changing fortunes signalled either embarrassment or schadenfreude respectively for the various actors in the Irish peace process. During the Irish conflict, at some secret level as a public recent inquiry indicated, the British government was complicit in death squads responsible for murders like those of human rights defenders Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane. US law itself now seems to include many provisions detention without trial, special tribunals, restrictions on legal support already routine in anti-terrorist legislation in Latin America. Similarly, it is only natural that US governments, with their long record of exploiting the covert action possibilities of narcotics in south-east Asia, Afghanistan and Central America, should help corrupt the rule of law in Colombia and elsewhere. In countries that implement such legislation ironically, Ireland is one such country the word of a single police officer or informer can be sufficient to put people in prison for ten years or more. The way anti-terror legislation is managed in the courts and covered by the media is a ready measure of the hypocrisy of so many politicians and journalists about the liberties they say they are upholding.

Brooks said Wednesday that hes more aligned with Trumps agenda than Strange, the candidate of a Washington swamp establishment who gets his support from a super political action committee tied to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Brooks said perhaps the president is unaware that Strange was appointed by a scandal-battered governor and that he, and not Strange, supports Trumps idea of changing Senate filibuster rules, which Democrats have used to kill proposals that cant get 60 votes. Strange, who called Trumps election a Biblical miracle, said hes honored by the presidents support. The endorsement is a welcome boost for the Strange campaign, as all of the top Republican contenders in the Aug. 15 primary have openly tried to woo Trump voters in the state where Trump continues to enjoy heavy popularity. I respect President Trump, but I am baffled and disappointed Mitch McConnell and the Swamp somehow misled the president into endorsing Luther Strange, Brooks statement said.

Yet the Media Matters report shows that climate skeptics still get plenty of air time, and one of their top talking points, the pause, filtered deeply into press coverage. Meanwhile, Media Matters also found that the New York Times, Reuters, the Associated Press, and USA Today avoided quoting climate skeptics; not every media outlet felt a misguided desire to achieve balance. Thats no crime in and of itself: It really depends on how these outlets covered this issue of the global warming pause, which has been blown out of proportion by climate skeptics but was also lent credence in a leaked draft of the IPCC report itself. According to Media Matters, 41 percent* of overall news coverage of the IPCC report, and 49 percent of newspaper coverage, contained a discussion of the idea that the planet has not warmed in the last 15 years or so. Media Matters found that many of the outlets that brought up the pause did explain that it doesnt mean global warming has gone away. * Update: Media Matters study originally reported that CNN had not covered the alleged global warming pause, a finding we cited in this article. Perhaps Fox has grown even more skeptical since then; or perhaps there was a burst of skepticism associated with the new IPCC report in particular. Media Matters subsequently corrected its study to include additional CNN segments, some of which did, in fact, mention the pause. Overall, thats a bad thing, because the meme has been widely used to cast doubt on the urgency of dealing with climate change.

Conventional wisdom holds that in a rising interest rate environment, investors usually shed dividend stocks as they look towards fixed income instead. Try 90 percent, according to money managers BlackRock Inc. That may explain a curious phenomenon happening with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on dividends. Once interest rates rise and bonds start paying out more, investors desire for some dividend payers (utilities, say) tends to wane, putting downward pressure on share prices. And second, when high-flying speculative stocks come crashing down to earth, investors take refuge in sturdier sectors with proven revenues and long dividend histories. But which dividend ETFs might be smart plays going forward, and how can you pick among them? A tanking share price will push a yield higher, or companies will offer sky-high dividends in order to lure investors and patch over financials that are in mortal danger. That is because in a flat or down market investors tend to gravitate towards safer defensive plays like dividend stocks.

AMD also recently revamped its graphics-chip designs, looking to take share away from Nvidia, which has nearly 80% of the market for stand-alone graphics chips by revenue. But AMD recently launched chips that represent the first real competition for Intel in that market for years. Intel's new product give it a shot at some of the revenue that usually goes to those graphics chips, while generating new sales for AMD and muscling in on Nvidia's dominance in graphics units. Rivals Intel and AMD Team Up on PC Chips to Battle Nvidia.Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., archrivals for decades, are teaming up to thwart a common competitor, Nvidia Corp. Intel planned to announce Monday a laptop-computer chip that combines an Intel processor and an AMD graphics unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. For several quarters, Nvidia's business selling chips to data centers has been up by triple digits from the previous year, presumably displacing sales of Intel processors. Gaming PCs typically require both Intel processors and high-end graphics chips from AMD or Nvidia. Intel competes head-on with Nvidia in driving artificial-intelligence calculations for large internet companies. The Intel chip will appeal to serious gamers, he said. The AMD unit, which the company expects to ship by the end of the year, is capable of running games, but not specialized for that purpose. Intel last year acquired technology to compete for that business with the purchase of Nervana Systems, and it expects those chips to start shipping by the end of the year. The chip is intended for laptops that are thin and lightweight but powerful enough to run high-end videogames--attributes that lately have been driving sales in an otherwise waning market for personal computers.",1,3

Excluding the 2014 spinoff of Halyard Health, Kimberly-Clark has undergone three true stock spinoffs in its recent history (post-1980): There's nothing specific about the dates, but a non-split adjusted chart of Kimberly-Clark's stock prices since 1978 shows what is really important -- the price. Additionally, if you look over most of the highest-returning stocks over the last 20 years, it's more than likely these companies have performed some type of stock split, and maybe even more than one. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! Long story short, Kimberly-Clark is overdue for a stock split, but investors should pay more attention to the company's operational performance. If price and history are of any indication, Kimberly-Clark is due for another stock split. A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. So while the company has broken from past tradition of splitting its stock when the price broke the $100 barrier, the question is, should investors care? In the short run, there's generally a boost in the stock price once a company performs a stock split. As an extreme example, one share of The Coca-Cola Company purchased in 1919 is now the equivalent of 9,200 shares due to the company's 11 stock splits. The lower stock price generally allows more investors to take a stake in the company.

Some observers have likened Arpaio to a modern-day Bull Connor, the notorious and blustering public safety commissioner of Birmingham, Ala. who brazenly defied federal law, unleashed dogs and turned powerful water hoses on Civil Rights protesters in the 1960s. Arpaios practices and persona bear a painful resemblance to the anti-Black racism of southern sheriffs in the 1960sand the continued racist practices of many urban police forces today. Arpaio was an equal-opportunity oppressor, challenging the legitimacy of the nations first Black president as part of the racist birther movement while rounding up and inhumanely persecuting documented and undocumented Latinx Ariz. residents. And the Black and Brown unity platform of the Expanded Sanctuary Movement, spearheaded by Mijente and Black Youth Project 100 to oppose the criminalization of Black and Brown communities, is yet another example of organizers taking seriously the slogan, same enemy, same fight. Today, the Movement for Black Lives has foregrounded the fact that racist police violence and mistreatment are systemic and persistent, even after police forces have been desegregated. Trumps pardon of Arpaio, once referred to by detainees as Hitler, comes at a perilous time in this nations history.

In fact, the State of Washington recently completed a project aimed at preventing future mudslides, just short distance away from the site of this weekends deadly tragedy. The most immediate cause of the mudslide is a near-record pace of rainfall for the area so far in the month of March. The Pacific Northwest has had an exceptionally wet finish to its rainy season, as storms that historically would have hit California were re-routed northward by a semi-permanent dome of high pressure thats been mostly responsible for the intensifying drought there. Thats because storms can draw upon water vapor from regions 10 to 25 times larger than the specific area where the rain or snow actually falls. Again, from the Seattle Times: Sixteen months ago, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) completed a $13.3 million project, called the Skaglund Hill Permanent Slide Repair, to secure an area just west of Saturdays slide, on the opposite side of the Stillaguamish River. This particular mudslide wasnt just a freak event brought about by heavy rain, although this months deluge surely speeded the process. One of the most well-forecast and consequential components of human-caused climate change is the tendency for rainstorms to become more intense as the planet warms. Global Change Research Programs (USGCRP) most recent report, scientists have observed less rain falling in light precipitation events and more rain falling in the heaviest precipitation events across the United States. As the effect becomes more pronounced, that will make follow-on events like flooding and landslides more common. In 2005, heavy rains caused groundwater levels to rise, re-mobilizing the previous debris flow and creating a repeat tragedy.

Advocate: New teacher evaluation overlooks special ed students.As state officials prepare to roll out a new teacher evaluation that is partially tied to student test scores, a leading advocate wants them to think long and hard to avoid adopting a process that inadvertently harms special education students. Access Livings Rod Estvan cautions that one of two scenarios could emerge if officials rush too quickly with the new evaluations: The test scores of special education students could be discounted, which would be bad news because teachers would not be held responsible for teaching them. Jennifer Ridder, a DePaul masters student who helped research the Access Living paper, says she was surprised to find how little research has been done on special education students and teacher evaluations based on student test score growth. Among the recommendations, outlined by Access Livings Rod Estvan in a paper released Wednesday, are: Under the states new teacher evaluation law, called the Performance Evaluation Reform Act, part of a teachers evaluation must be tied to test score growth. Estvan says he is concerned that the timeline doesnt leave much chance for CPS and other districts to fully consider how subgroups, such as special education and bilingual students, should be incorporated into the teacher evaluation system. At least initially, CPS will use an already-developed ISAT-based value-added formula.#160; But at the same time, it is in the midst of preparing to give a new test based on the Common Core Standards, which are seen to be more rigorous than state standards. Or, the test scores could be factored into the equation just like the scores of students who are in regular educationanother bad deal, since it could lead to teachers maneuvering to keep test scores up by keeping special education students out of their classes. He notes that under the current system, an increasing number of special education students are given an alternative, easier assessment thats supposed to be reserved for students with the most severe disabilities.

Luck, who has not taken a snap in a game since Week 17 last season, underwent surgery to repair a torn labrum on Jan. 15. The Colts decided to place Luck on injured reserve Nov. 2 following his visit with doctors to ask why he still had soreness in his right shoulder. Luck is optimistic he can avoid another surgery based on the results of his extended European treatment and rehab, sources told ESPN. The move ended months of speculation about whether Luck would play this season. If the pain returns during the throwing stage, an urgent discussion will occur for Luck to undergo a corrective surgery that involves relocating the biceps tendon that is attached to the repaired labrum, ESPN reported. When he resumes throwing in the near future, those throws will be determined whether he needs corrective surgery in January to address the setbacks that unexpectedly sidelined him for the 2017 season, according to the report. Lucks treatment and rehab of his surgically shoulder apparently is going well, sources told ESPNs Chris Mortensen.

I can't speak for a whole generation, but to the extent we didn't make too bad a mess of our personal lives, the boomers I grew up with made out well enough under the center-right and centrist governments in power during the years we raised our families. Prior to Obama's re-election, I believed that it was morally wrong for my generation to pass a crushing national debt on to the next one. The debt will top $20 trillion before Obama moves out of the White House, and it will include spiraling retirement-related costs that the administration has shown zero interest in bringing under control, largely driven by baby boomers piling into the Social Security and Medicare systems. The 18-29 year olds who helped lift Obama to victory apparently lack an aversion to radicalism and, as Mr. Schindler says, seem largely unconcerned about the nation's debt crisis. But if the 18-29 year olds don't grow up fast, they very likely will raise their families under far less advantageous conditions than we boomers did. Every generation must find its own way and, in doing so, ordinarily is entitled to its share of mistakes. But at least we managed to avoid electing a radical president.

Watch The 1 Percent Gobble Up The Country’s Income.Mark Thoma has shared some maps put together by a graduate student at the University of Oregon, where he teaches, which show how inequality has changed in each state since 1977. The top 10 percent of earners now take home half the countrys income, the largest share ever recorded. Wall Street deregulation brought big profits, boosting the incomes of the 1 percent who clustered in finance. The trend started in the 1970s, as the richest 20 percent saw incomes grow by $2,550 by the 2000s but the bottom 20 percent saw just $1,330. During that time, the rich saw their incomes grow, but everyone else actually saw them decline. And while social spending has helped to keep income inequality lower, the U.S. is set to cut $1.5 trillion in spending over the next decade. Changes in the tax code favored capital gains income, or money made through investment instead of through a salary, which boosted the incomes of the rich. Watch the states turn from deep red to dark green over the past 35 years: This is just one indicator of growing inequality.

In 2012, Fight for 15 and OUR Walmart hinted that the mainstream labor movement had finally moved beyond the outmoded forms of NLRB-centered unionism, finding strategies that allowed it to connect with the most exploited workers. For the incredibly dedicated and hardworking activists who make staffing these organizations their lifes work, this structure often produces heartbreaking contradictions, particularly when union leaders make decisions that fall short of labor activists values. We need more people willing to spend several years organizing unions in their workplaces, becoming active members of their communities, and experimenting with new forms of worker organization until we figure out what worksjust as the militants who built the upsurge of the 1930s did. As union density drops to pre-NLRB levels and right-to-work legislation eats into labors coffers, mainstream unions will need to find new ways to organize. A shift toward salting in non-union shops would help develop a culture of struggle behind enemy lines from which new movements would emerge. From the passage of the NLRA until today, the labor left lost a series of battles with these so-called new men of power, allowing business unionism to become dominant. Unlike getting a union or NGO staff job, taking time outside of work to be an activist, or becoming an academic, worker-centered organizing is immediately accessible to working-class people, and doesnt depend on a paycheck from bureaucracies",1,1

Three projects from this year's MC2, held at Eagle Eyrie Baptist Conference Center July 14-19, illustrate the way God uses these mission experiences to touch lives. Before leaving for home that evening, Jennie Dyke made a request: She asked if Mandze could join our group next year, stay on the mountain with us, and work in Lynchburg doing missions so she could give back as others had given to them, said Shereda. Led by Kathy Shereda, pastor of High Hills Baptist Church in Jarratt, and her husband, Paul, this group replaced the kitchen floor, hung new sheetrock, plastered and painted, and installed new screen on several doors and the back porch. MC2 also included dynamic, intergenerational worship; opportunities to meet and learn from missionaries; and afternoon seminar sessions on a wide range of topics, such as healthy dating, self-esteem and discerning a call to ministry. In another Lynchburg neighborhood, a team of six youth from Linden Heights Baptist Church in Staunton and Bowling Green Baptist Church in Bowling Green renovated several rooms in the home of Jennie Dyke.

The Daily Beast spoke with Protect Our Defenders, an advocacy group for military sexual assault victims that has made getting new legislation passed one of its priorities. ""In the immediate term we're doing all we can to work with Senator Gillibrand to get the act passed into law to ensure that professional trained military prosecutors, rather than the accused's commanders, determines whether a case should be prosecuted. Two leading advocates for military-sexual assault reform reacted to Neubauer's story and discussed the Senate vote expected this week on the issue. Gillibrand Reacts to Air Force Rape Case First Reported by The Daily Beast.The story of Airman Jane Neubauer, who was allegedly raped and then hung out to dry by the Air Force, is one of many that show why Congress must reform the way sexual assault cases are handled by the military. Gillibrand has expressed confidence that when the time comes she will have the 60 votes she needs, but her proposals have put her at odds with both military officials and fellow lawmakers. In response to Neubauer's story, Gillibrand spokesperson Glen Caplin provided this statement: ""This survivor's story raises issues we have heard in other cases, for example, another special victim counsel has told us they can't get information, and even recommend to survivors they not report. Senator Gillibrand believes it is Congress' obligation to restore this trust throughout the system by creating a military justice system that is free of the inherent bias and conflicts of interest."" Parrish called Neubauer's case a ""stark but horrendous example of an arbitrary and chaotic justice system where there is little to no transparency or accountability of those who abuse their authority.

Before Sherrod, the cause celebre of the You Must Fear Obama campaign involved something called the New Black Panther Party. The Sherrod case has fully exposed the right-wing campaign to use racial fear to destroy Obamas presidency, and I hope the effect is to finally stiffen some spines in the administration. With the Obama presidency, though, has come a flurry of charges from the likes of Breitbart but also from more substantial conservative figures about alleged incidences of racial discrimination against whites by blacks and other minorities. For one thing, the incident happened in 1986 when she was working for a nonprofit, long before she joined the Obama administration. Most of them, however, are merely seeking political gain by inviting white voters to question the motives and good faith of the nations first African-American president. Andrew Breitbart, a smarmy provocateur who often speaks at tea party rallies, posted on his website a video snippet of a speech that Sherrod, who is African-American, gave to a NAACP meeting earlier this year. It wont work with most people, of course, but it works with some enough, perhaps, to help erode Obamas political standing and damage his partys prospects at the polls. Remember the over-the-top reaction when it was learned that Justice Sonia Sotomayor had once talked about how being a wise Latina might affect her thinking. Yet Sherrod was fired before even being allowed to tell her side of the story. The full video of Sherrods speech showed she wasnt bragging about being a racist, she was telling what amounted to a parable about prejudice and reconciliation. In it, Sherrod seemed to boast of having withheld from a white farmer some measure of aid that she would have given to a black farmer.",1,1

4821,"Short-sighted politicians will use a tough on crime agenda to criticize judges for letting pre-trial detainees out of custody. The losers come in two categories; the taxpayers who fund the overcrowded jails, and those defendants with insufficient resources to pay for their release (who often spend more time in jail waiting for a trial than they would have ever received as a sentence). Just as they are required to hold clearly dangerous people without bond, they must also release those who would be out if not for the fact they were poor. We stand at a moment when this illogical way of making release decisions, based on money, can disappear and be replaced with a system that relies on objective factors. Historically we have made these release decisions based on how much money a person has, or whether a family member can sign over enough collateral to a private bondsman. When bonding companies categorize releases as lenient and cynical politicians accuse judges of being soft on crime, as a community we must remember the constitution. In other words, the system we have been using for years actually makes our community less safe by increasing crime. Another group of powerful voices against these changes are elected officials who wish to capitalize on crime to further their own political ambitions. Releasing people prior to their trial on the least restrictive means available is the law not an act of leniency. If implemented correctly, the vast majority of people charged with non-violent offenses will be released while they wait for their trial. They, too, face re-election, but they must enforce both sides of our new constitutional amendment, regardless of what political pressure is brought to bear. This approach will undoubtedly rear its head every time a notorious crime takes place in our state.",0,0

If you make $100,000 or more, you probably pay a significant amount of your income to the IRS every year at tax time. Qualified dividend and long-term capital gains income both get lower tax rates than ordinary income. In some cases, investment income is tax-free, while other cases involve reduced rates that provide partial savings. Even though municipal bonds typically carry lower interest rates than taxable bonds, the effective after-tax yield on munis can be higher than on regular bonds -- especially for those who make six figures and are in higher tax brackets. No one likes to pay tax, and those who make $100,000 or more pay a lot of it. Even with this caveat, taking more deductions from your home is an area in which high-income taxpayers can get a big break.

CA struggles to curb heroin spike.As loosening marijuana regulation and enforcement upends the drug culture in California, heroin use has become an increasing problem in the Golden State, new hospital data suggested. Raul Benitez-Manaut, who researches#160;the drug war at the National Autonomous University in Mexico, told the Post that#160;pot decriminalization has given U.S. consumers access to high-quality marijuana, with genetically improved strains, grown in greenhouses. Along with five others, Foster was charged with conspiracy to distribute#160;heroin and oxycodone, in addition to marijuana: The arrests, which were announced at a news conference Thursday afternoon at the FBI office in northwest Fresno, stemmed from an intensive ongoing, year-long joint investigation by the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that involved considerable surveillance and wiretaps, said U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner, the regions top federal law-enforcement official. Since then, the Golden States place on the#160;front lines of Mexican drug smuggling has remained unchanged. The seizure of the half-pound of heroin in Navarros three residences increased the amount of the drug seized so far by the team in the county this year to nearly 4 kilos, more than it has confiscated over the past five years combined, reported Patch from Gilroy.

6531,"I think it does suggest that a portion of Uyghurs within China are starting to resort to violence to get their message across and its also notable that we are seeing this happening outside of Xinjiang. There are good reasons why its in the Chinese interests to make the threat seem more organized, more internationalized and more coherent than it is because the more it sounds like an indigenous, diffuse set of grievances among downtrodden people the harder it is to garner international sympathy to link it to the war on terror. Theres obviously a lot of Han Chinese who are extremely worried about this situation and that can spiral into all kinds of retribution like we saw in 2009 in Urumqi where those tensions exploded into inter-ethnic riots. I imagine in Xinjiang this will lead to another rounding up of suspected separatists, extremists, terrorists, whatever they want to call them, but thats been going on non-stop for the last 10 or 20 years. Weve seen lots of reports over the last several years of local groups going to police stations and then violence erupting and all those things didnt seem to be any sort of premeditated attack. I dont think theres any part of Chinese politics thats going to enable them right now to try to address some of those underlying grievances, but I think thats the only long-term way out of this. I think in all likelihood these (latest attacks) were carried out by Uyghurs and most likely they were premeditated acts of terror to get out a message, but that doesnt necessarily mean its associated with some larger jihadist network. What is maybe more troubling about this particular incident is that it will probably affect Uyghurs who are living outside of Xinjiang a lot more. I think theres fairly strong evidence that the Kunming attack was perpetrated by Uyghurs as well. In the last couple of decades theres been a concerted effort to develop Xinjiang, integrate it more into the Chinese state and also create a platform for expanding Chinese economic interests westward and southward. I think its because they are asking for either political autonomy or territorial concessions and thats not something Chinas traditionally been in the business of giving out.",0,2
3863,"The 79-page complaint, filed Tuesday in#160;federal court in Texas, alleges the regulation improperly redefines the definition of sex under federal law, forces healthcare professionals to disregard their medical judgment and religious beliefs and undermines state authority to regulate health care. (Washington Blade file photo by Michael Key) A new lawsuit filed by religious-affiliated health care providers and five states seeks to overturn a regulation under Obamacare prohibiting discrimination against transgender people in#160;transition-related care, including gender reassignment surgery. Ultimately, this case boils down to a very simple question of statutory interpretation: Can HHS redefine the term sex to thwart decades of settled precedent and impose massive new obligations on healthcare professionals and sovereign States? Lori Windham, senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said the lawsuit is necessary to ensure medical care remains between doctors and their patients without the federal government being involved. Defying legal precedent establishing that transgender discrimination amounts to gender discrimination under current law, the lawsuit seeks an injunction barring enforcement of the regulation on the basis it is invalid under the Administrative Procedure Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the First, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. In May, the Department of Health amp; Human Services made final a rule interpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender in health care, to apply to transgender and gender-nonconforming people, including for the purposes of transition-related care. Although HHS was asked to include a religious exemption in the regulation due to the obvious implications for religious healthcare providers, HHS#160;declined to do so, stating instead that religious objectors could assert claims under#160;existing statutory protections for religious freedom, the lawsuit says.

On the matter of principal retention, the School Board and the general superintendent would have been the only parties involved in deciding whether to overturn a councils decision; the three-member panel later was added as a compromise. Board officials say the proposal would simply provide clearer criteria for deciding whether to retain sitting principals. Although board officials announced some changes, they presented no new language to the House committee, making the debate, in the words of committee Chair Larry Woolard (D-Carterville), a discussion on something that aint. Opponents see the current committee as being stacked against LSCs: two members come from groups appointed entirely or in large part by the School Board, and the third would be a representative from the principals group. Other parts of the boards proposed legislation would require LSC members to submit to criminal background checks, give board officials a new intervention tool to regulate possible financial mismanagement, and set some new restrictions on councils when principals are being selected. An LSCs decision to let a principal go at the end of a four-year contract would be subject to review if the principal had received a satisfactory rating or better on his or her most recent evaluation by School Board officials.

In front of a 2,000 person-strong crowd, he praised the Postal Services provision of universal service six days a week to every corner of America, no matter how small or how remote, and linked attacks on the agency to attempts to privatize Social Security, Medicare and public schooling, as well as a broader assault on the working class. He went on to note that Sanders longstanding support for workers rights in general had played a role in the APWUs endorsement, such as his fight for the $15 minimum wage, his defense of and proposal to expand Social Security and Medicare, and his opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership. The#160; APWU, which represents more than 200,000 current and retired U.S. postal workers and close to 2,000 private sector mail workers, cited Sanders work in preventing the closure of mail processing facilities and post offices for the endorsement, as well as his spearheading of a sense of the Senate resolution in January to improve delivery response time for the United States Postal Service (USPS).

The day before the vote, the woman who decried the non-existent death panels began tweeting that the health care bill would undercut medical plans for military personnel. In recent days, it has seemed as if practically every Democrat in Washington has memorized this list: tax credits for small business owners purchasing health insurance for their employees, banning insurance companies from booting customers when they get sick, prohibiting those companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing conditions (the same prohibition relating to adults will come later), ending lifetime limits on health care benefits, filling the so-called Medicare prescription drug donut hole, allowing young people to remain on their parents policies until their 26th birthday, and more. But if his comments reflect a wider sentiment within Republican circles, its possible the GOP could be struck by an internal division over the health care reform fight: Do Republicans move on, or do they act like those fabled Japanese soldiers stranded on deserted islands at the end of World War II who never realized the war was over and that they had lost?

Last summer, the first two-week Chan trial also ended in a mistrial after jurors deliberated for 14 hours and could not reach a unanimous verdict. The jury heard dozens of witnesses, including friends who were with the two deputies at a bar that night; hotel guests who heard a scuffle and shots fired on the seventh floor; law enforcement officers who responded to the scene as well as investigators and hired experts. Third Judicial District Judge Fernando Macias declared a mistrial Tuesday after jurors deliberated three and a half hours and declared they could not reach a unanimous decision. Witnesses said the two men argued at a restaurant-pub over a double-homicide case but it didnt get physical. The state accused Chan of deliberately killing his law enforcement partner Jeremy Martin in October 2014 after a drunken night out and asked the jury to return a guilty verdict of murder in the first degree. Third Judicial District Attorney Mark DAntonio, who prosecuted the case, said he would decide within a week or so whether to try the case a third time. Day said that six of the jurors said he was outright not guilty on a second pass. His four children deserve to be told that the man who shot their father in the back, that there are consequences for that behavior, she said. ADVERTISEMENT Chans attorneys claimed he shot Martin in self-defense and asked the jury to find him not guilty. In his closing rebuttal, prosecutor DAntonio called Chan a heartless killer, a wolf cloaked in the uniform of men and women whose duty is to serve and protect other people who made a deliberate and calculated act to kill Deputy Martin right then and there.

If you ask a lot of the young women, they will say that theyre either affiliated with a gang, belong to an auxiliary gang or have their own gangs. MCL: The most dangerous kind of girl involvement with gangs is one where the girls are just sort of hanging around the gang boys or even being part of the male gang. Some early gang work in the 50s tried to take the girl gangs and turn them into social clubs because in many ways that was already how they were functioning. And according to Meda Chesney-Lind, a member of the Justice Departments Office of Juvenile Justice and Deliquency Prevention Girls Study Group, gangs fulfill dramatically different needs for female than for male members, and girls experience of gang life is in many respects quite distinct from boys. Girls in gangs typically dont carry guns, they certainly dont brandish them the way male gang members do. The phrase we like to use is present but invisible, because the people who studied men in gangs tended to ignore the girls or only ask the boys about the girls. [Even if] those are labeled as a way to get into the gang, its not a stretch to say theyre [] gang rapes. One of the differences between boy gangs and girl gangs is for girls its much more relational and much less violent. It also gets girls into legal trouble because a lot of the gang activities tend to be quite violent. If youre doing gang peacemaking, I hope that the menand its almost always men who work in these youth-serving agenciesrealize that there are girls there and that they need to hire young women from those ethnic groups to work with those young women. In some instances, especially in the Latino community, the boys have very traditional views of femininity even though they are gang members.",1,1

Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), once the largest American bank by assets, recently told worried U.S. regulators it would consider a geographic retreat if its financial problems deepen, according to a new published report. According to the Journal, in its filing with the Fed, BofA also listed a potential sale of a separate class of shares tied to Merrill Lynch, which has helped offset weakness at its parent company. BofA has been hit harder than most of its peers by the economic downturn, but it has also been slammed by the poorly-timed acquisitions of Merrill Lynch, Countrywide Financial and their combined legal woes.

According to The Wall Street Journal, BofA listed a geographic retrenchment as a potential move on a list of emergency scenarios requested by the Federal Reserve last year.

These days, Mr. McCarthy has regained his influence, buoyed by what many Republicans describe as the strongest personal connection with Mr. Trump and his top advisers of any GOP leader. Back in March 2016, Mr. McCarthy was predicting in speeches that Mr. Trump could help the House GOP pick up seats that fall. Mr. Short's relationship with Mr. McCarthy dates back almost a decade to his time as chief of staff for the House Republican Conference -- headed by then-Rep. Mike Pence, now the vice president. And while Mr. McCarthy called for Mr. Trump to apologize after video from 2005 was released last October showing Mr. Trump, then the GOP presidential nominee, talking about kissing and groping women without their consent, he still believed Mr. Trump could win the election. Conservatives who have long tangled with GOP leaders say they appreciate Mr. McCarthy's willingness to hear their concerns. In the wake of a television interview in which he implied political motives in the House hearings into an attack on a U.S. compound in Libya, Mr. McCarthy pulled out of the race to replace Rep. John Boehner as speaker. It isn't clear whether the California GOP, which gathers in Mr. McCarthy's office for a weekly lunch, usually Mexican food, will splinter on the tax legislation itself, a much tougher vote. Mr. McCarthy, 52 years old, has already been involved in helping the House GOP clear key hurdles that threatened to clutter the tax bill's path. ""I was happy to hear about the governors' newfound concerns for the ridiculous high-tax burdens we have,"" Mr. McCarthy said on a call with reporters.

Meanwhile, monitors from the Fair Labor Association an NGO formed by human rights groups and companies including Nike itself wont start their work until this summer or fall because its taken a lot longer than we or Phil thought to get the FLA monitoring established, says Kidd. Kidd says Nike factories have reduced use of petroleum-based chemicals by 88 percent since 1995, and while he cant swear no Nike workers are ever exposed, were as close to being at that standard or better as we can reasonably expect to be. For instance, in the wake of revelations in 1997 that workers in one Vietnamese factory were being exposed to toxic fumes at dozens of times the legal limit, Knight promised that all Nike factories would meet the US governments indoor air quality standards.

From a tax-efficiency standpoint, index exchange-traded funds are also often described as a better bet than their mutual fund counterparts, partly because they keep turnover low but also because they produce fewer capital gains using a mechanism known as ""in-kind redemptions."" Your tax liability Mutual funds that are not held in a tax-advantaged account produce taxable distributions each year in the form of dividend income, interest generated from bond funds and capital gains, created when securities held within the fund are sold. Mutual fund investors who have assets in both taxable and tax-deferred accounts can better their odds of enjoying a comfortable retirement by taking an interest in tax efficiency. Time your purchase When buying dividend-paying mutual funds, the tax-conscious investor should also be mindful of year-end distribution dates. One fund, however, has an after-tax return of 9%, and the other has 7%. Michael Rawson, a fund analyst for Morningstar, notes tax-efficient funds tend to be pricier than similar funds from the same provider.

The French Union of Islamic Organisations called it a genocide without precedent which does take the biscuit when even the Popes minister for peace and justice has compared Gaza to a big concentration camp. Before I state the obvious, I only wish the French Union of Islamic Organisations would call the Armenian genocide a genocide it doesnt have the courage to do so, does it, because that would be offensive to the Turks and, well, the million and a half Armenians massacred in 1915 happened to be, er, Christians.

And even Israel doesnt use the word genocide about the Armenians lest it loses its only Muslim ally in the Middle East. Mind you, that didnt stop George Bush from dropping the word from his vocabulary lest he, too, should offend the Turkish generals whose airbases America needs for its continuing campaign in Iraq.

Sadly, the people who watch Hannity and Fox and Friends will never be told about these factual details.

And what Hannity calls the worst part of this whole story was a blatant lie. You know, all this talk about Trump/Russia collusion, the only person that colluded in that campaign with the Russians, was Hillary Clinton.

If your technology isnt keeping up with your business, then its time to investigate cost-effective solutions like cloud software, multifunction applications for customer relationship management (CRM) and collaboration, and hardware upgrades. Its possible that for certain functions, your business can choose from the growing arsenal of free Web apps which typically have limited functionality and support, but allow you to experiment with little financial risk. When he looked at putting email in the cloud, he determined after a cost evaluation that retaining the in-house-managed Microsoft Exchange application would be cheaper in the long run. Full-featured email programs such as Microsoft Outlook continue to be one of the most significant collaboration technologies for small companies, Eastman says. You can use online systems from Google, piece together other smaller apps, or go with an on-premises system such as Microsoft SharePoint 2010, as SBLI did.

In his introduction to the 2013-2014 Annual Report, Alexander Cherkasov, Chairman of the Memorial Board, stated, Regrettably, a significant part of our efforts had to go into protecting ourselves If we are tempted to see this as prototypically Russian, the sort of the thing that couldnt or wouldnt happen in a free society like the United States, we should resist. The conversation, at one point, turned to rights of free speech when one of the young Russian men at the table said If I were to criticize the government I might have to whisper, because someone might be listening. Peace and environmental activists across the country can tell stories about organized, approved demonstrations where they are shunted off to a designated protest area typically far from the event and people they seek to address.

While debate rages in the US about illegal aliens, foreign H1visa experts and Chinese EB-5 investor visas, the US edition of the China Daily reports that one of the fastest growing Chinese demographics in the US is Chinese pensioners. As buying property is one of the quickest and easiest ways to invest a million dollars in the US, restrictions on the EB-5 visa could negatively impact the US real-estate market. Forbes Magazine's Kenneth Rapoza reported that Trump opponents speculate that while the president may order mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and crackdown on the H1B visas, he will not restrict the EB-5 visa because the program provides much needed investment capital, which helps the US economy. The final group, Chinese pensioners are quietly increasing in number and could become a further drain on US social security which is already threatened by America's own ageing crisis. Economic Impact of Trump Immigration Policies on Chinese.Three groups of Chinese are facing very different forms of US immigration and possible changes under the new administration.

With Trump's tightening of immigration laws, many investors are wary about investing in the US until they know whether the EB-5 will remain in place. The H1B visas are widely used by the IT, engineering, and other high tech industries in order to attract foreign talent to work in US firms. Adam Hartung of Forbes Magazine felt that not enough attention was being paid to this group who will add to an already ageing US population and potentially become a burden on the US social system.

The dispute between Lovelace Health Plan and ABQ Health Partners shows that meaningful health care reform isnt as simple as one would hope. ADVERTISEMENT The challenge is coming up with a way to pay physicians and other providers so they make money by providing improved and more efficient care. The suit claims HealthCare Partners uses its control of health plan members to put large numbers of patients into the hospitals where it gets the best deals, and thereby lowers its expenditures and improves its profits. If the practice underestimates its costs, Lovelace is still on the hook to make sure its members get the care they require.

Chris Cannon, at one point suggested that nursing homes install granny-cams, so that the residents loved ones could keep an eye on them remotely, as a way of improving the quality of care, rather than eliminate arbitration clauses. Gadberrys suggestion that arbitration was a benefit to elderly nursing home residents didnt go down well with the committees chairwoman, Rep. Linda Sanchez, a Democrat from California, whose siblings, to her dismay, recently signed an arbitration clause to put her father into a nursing home. Even before Connor opened his mouth, Republicans on the committee were trying to minimize the impact of his powerful testimony and to avoid looking like heartless corporate shills not fully committed to life. Rather than fix the nursing homes, at the urging of the industry (represented by Gadberry), Texas essentially got rid of the lawsuits with a 2003 tort reform measure that makes it virtually impossible to sue a nursing home on behalf of an elderly person today. And while Connor invoked the standard trial lawyer arguments about the need to keep the courthouse open to those whove suffered at the hands of heartless corporations, he did it in distinctly evangelical language. Thats why Republicans really, really dont want to vote for the nursing home bill, and one reason Connors advocacy is making them squirm.

Associate editor of the Daily Caller, Scott Greer, blamed Ahmed for his own arrest, arguing that the teenager ""should have had the good sense"" to keep his clock put away: Of course, if it was just a clock Mohamed brought to show off to a teacher, the school was out of bounds. National Review Online correspondent Kevin D. Williamson declared Ahmed's controversial arrest to be ""a phony case of Islamophobia,"" and attacked President Obama and other public figures for expressing support for Ahmed, calling their actions ""cheap moral preening,"" and arguing that the story only received attention because it ""can be used to further a story"" about racism in the United States: The story immediately became ubiquitous not because of what actually happened -- boneheaded as that was -- but because it can be used to further a story that the media already want to tell: that the United States is morally corrupt and irredeemably racist; that Muslims are under siege; that ""white privilege"" blinds the majority of Americans to the corruption at the heart of everything red, white, and blue. On the September 17 edition of The Rush Limbaugh Show, Limbaugh attacked President Obama for supposedly using Ahmed's experience to make his own ""star shine a little bit brighter,"" and blamed Ahmed and ""zero-tolerance"" school policies for fueling the arrest: RUSH: So the point here is that the effort is being made to blame school officials and the cops for Islamophobia here, and that is not what is going on.

The protests culminated in a bloody confrontation with police sent by Igualas former mayor, Jos Luis Abarca, and his wife, who allegedly feared the demonstrations would interrupt an event she was hosting. During the clashes, six people were killed and 43 students disappeared reportedly at the hands of police officers, who, according to witnesses, turned the students over to members of a local drug gang who are said to have confessed to burning the bodies and throwing the remains in a river.

It took about 20 minutes for all of us to stuff the balloon into a large red bag made of the same ripstop nylon as the balloon itself.

On the other hand, if your current employer's plan looks better, consolidating your 401(k) accounts could be the best idea. Overall contribution limitsIf you have more than one active 401(k) account, you need to be aware that the IRS's contribution limit for elective deferrals refers to your combined 401(k) accounts. Or, if you work multiple jobs, you might be offered 401(k) plans from more than one employer simultaneously. With self-employment income, these people can set up and contribute to an individual 401(k) even if they have another 401(k) at their job. Finally, you also have the option of rolling over your old 401(k) into an IRA, which could give you much more control over your investments. For example, if you choose to contribute $15,000 to your primary employer's 401(k) plan, you would be limited to $3,000 in elective contributions to any other plans you participate in. If your old 401(k) has lower fees and you don't mind having your retirement savings in several places, by all means leave it alone. So, if you max out your $18,000 elective deferral in your primary 401(k), an employer could still contribute into another 401(k) plan for your benefit. In fact, it's rather common for people to have an old 401(k) account (or several) from their previous employer(s), in addition to their current one. In an IRA, you can invest in virtually any stocks, bonds, or funds you want, so if you want to take a more active role with your retirement planning, this could be a smart move for your old 401(k)s.

This will be the Courts second case regarding contraception and the fourth time it has considered certain facets of the Affordable Care Act. This particular case will decide what the standing will be for particular institutions such as schools and hospitals that happen to be associated with a particular religion or an organization representing a certain religion. The government had declared, with regard to these companies, that all they had to do was let the government and#160;their insurance carriers know of their objections and that they put their petition for exemption in writing.

However, this latest scheme doesnt appear to be about savings to the state; instead, Democrats under Steinbergs tutelage, seem to have found a back door approach to get counties to do their tax increases for them. To pay for the plan, Steinberg, Ducheny and the Senate Democrats want to give counties additional revenues to pay for the restructured services by implementing the following: Raise vehicle taxes, oil taxes, and the tax on government health care while cutting corporate incentives is how state Democrats propose to raise revenues also known as killing the goose that laid the golden egg. One benefit of restructuring according to Steinberg is that it eases the states revenue shortfall and enables smaller increases in state taxes and fewer devastating cuts in programs that serve the states most vulnerable populations.#160;Smaller increases in state taxes would those be the kind coming from counties?

Whether you're looking to sell your home or simply make it a more attractive place to live, these improvements will transform your space without busting your budget. Dented, dirty blinds can make your windows look old and dated -- so it pays to replace them with new window treatments, which, incidentally, don't have to cost a ton.

Of course, your costs might climb if you're working with a larger space or opt for truly high-end paint, but otherwise, it's a project you can do on the cheap. Rather than sink money into a series of professional cleanings, it often pays to replace carpet completely when it's in really bad shape. The problem, of course, is that new cabinetry can run you many thousands of dollars, depending on the size of your kitchen and materials you choose. 8 Ways to Transform Your Home on a Budget.Most people who own homes will agree that there's always room for some sort of improvement.

Clinton Backs Obama Rule To Ban Financial Advisers From Scamming Their Own Clients.On Monday evening, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took a new stance by backing the Obama administrations proposed rule to force financial advisers to act in their clients best interests, a standard many brokers today dont have to meet. But the proposal has met with a barrage of lobbying from the financial sector, which claims that the rules would put small brokers out of business and cut off financial advice from some people who need it most. The rule change would still allow brokers to earn commission and revenue sharing and have otherwise broad leeway in structuring payments. Republicans have also attacked it by including measures in legislation that would block the Department of Labor from implementing the new rules. It would also bar them from accepting payments, such as fees for recommending particular products, that could create conflicts of interest unless they enter into an exemption contract. That means they can legally steer clients into investing in products that make them or their firms more money but might not benefit the clients themselves. Investment advice given to pension managers is already subject to a fiduciary standard; advice about making 401(k) decisions, on the other hand, isnt always. Such conflicted advice has been estimated to collectively cost Americans about $17 billion a year that would have otherwise gone to their retirement savings, a large number considering a third has less than $1,000 stashed away. The issue has also taken on increasing importance as more and more American workers are given 401(k) retirement plans at work rather than pensions.

In fact, our liberties are at even greater risk with a Democratic president whose popularity is based on the false belief that Democrats are keepers of the flames of peace and justice when they are in fact the other side of the same corrupt coin. The Bush era assault on civil liberties has been strengthened by the Obama administration in every way possible, and deportation of immigrants is no exception.

When the apparatus of war reduces his neighbors, his family and himself to faceless, ungrievable statistics, Abu Saif doesnt merely try to give voice to the victims; just as importantly, he attempts to bestow a name and an individual subjectivity upon the faceless killer who guides the machinery of death. She argues that naming and singularizing the people who are killed in war, and experiencing grief on their behalf, can move us to action: Open grieving is bound up with outrage, and outrage in the face of injustice or indeed of unbearable loss has enormous political potential. In Gaza, the Drones Never Sleep.He might decide to terminate the life of someone walking along the pavement, or he might uproot a tree in an orchard that hasnt yet borne fruit. He preserves theat least potential humanity of the drone operator whose virtual presence at the family table represents, for Abu Saif, both the threat of imminent destruction and the hope for eventual justice. Relatives, neighbors and friends are introduced, but characters of almost equal importance are the faceless drones that hover above our narrators head and the nameless drone operators who sit at a safe distance deciding whom to target for death. Reading such a list of statistics of casualties during war can outrage and horrify if one identifies with those who are killedor simply identifies them as fully human. He resents the notion that he himself might be reduced to a name mentioned in a media roundup of those killed that day: I do not want to be a number, a piece of news, a name on the tongue of a beautiful TV presenter waiting impatiently to finish reading boring news from Gaza.

Thomas Smith, 52, had been working hard to get his life together and to try and set as good as an example for his teenaged children#160;as he could, reports The Washington Post. He was immediately grabbed by WalMart security people, interrogated, forced to sign a statement he couldnt read, and was then fired. After seeing the person who was using the cart drive away, he scooped the bottles and cans and took them into the store for the nickel deposit on each one. WalMart officials say that Smith was fired over a human resources situation that they would not discuss with the media. He was homeless for a time and then landed a $9 an hour job at the#160;East Greenbush, NY, at a local WalMart, rounding#160;up the stray shopping carts in the parking lot and returning them to the store. He said that he worked hard for the company but got a bad deal in the end. He was told he was fired for taking property into the store itself. In WalMarts eyes, Smith stole their empty bottles and cans, along with the $2 deposit refund from WalMart. Smith was forced to sign an admission of guilt that he couldnt read because he did not have any glasses. A campaign was launched on Thursday at an online crowdfunding site that looks to raise money for Smith. Smith was excited about his new job because it offered a steady paycheck and an opportunity to provide a stable and loving environment for his children.",0,2
8882,"Both Stamps and Sadlowski Garza say they were inspired to run, in part, by what last fall seemed a certain decision from Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis to challenge Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The mayors race is likely to play a different role in the 37th Ward, a majority black ward where Emanuel captured 41 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, Democrats for Education Reform, a group whose education agenda contrast strongly with that of the current CTU leadership, endorsed 14 aldermanic candidates; six won outright, three lost and five are headed into a runoff. Two educators vie for aldermanic seats in runoffs.On a bitter early-March afternoon, Tara Stamps calls out to a woman who has been watching her carefully from across North Keeler Avenue. Though health reasons ultimately put the brakes on her expected campaign, the unions progressive political agenda has continued and teachers have rallied behind Garcia, a Cook County commissioner. But they say the fact that Garcia forced Emanuel into a runoff increases the energy around the elections and, with luck, drives more people to the polls. Stamps is one of just two CPS educators who made it into runoffs two out of an unprecedented wave of eight teachers and counselors who ran campaigns to unseat incumbent aldermen in the Feb. 24 elections. Last week, Meegan decided to suspend his campaign after the citys Board of Elections certified Mell as the outright winner, with 17 votes more than the 50 percent minimum requirement. On the Saturday after the Feb. 24 elections, when provisional ballots had yet to be counted in the tight 33rd Ward race, CTU Vice President Jesse Sharkey said it was not a mistake that those three candidates appeared to have forced runoffs.

6991,"These latest state mandates come on the heels of a series of other state and federal mandates that board member Don Schlichte says either didn't work or didn't translate into effective programs, including No Child Left Behind, Common Core State Standards (which the district is optimistic about, but are unfunded), and an A-F grading systems for schools. ADVERTISEMENT But the state Public Education Department has directed state districts to train staff and implement an evaluation system that will cost the RRPS district an estimated $5 million according to RRPS Human Resources Director Sue Passell for employee training and the addition of more salaried administrators at each school. That's because the mandates take money away from the classrooms and place it in some form of accountability this time by implementing a new teacher and principal evaluation program. If that is confirmed as an accurate price tag for implementation just for our school district the state shouldn't be mandating such an enormous change in the review process without also making a financial commitment to support it. At least some school board members see those expenses as unfunded mandates and are willing to fight them. The district doesn't challenge the notion that employee reviews are necessary, nor do we challenge the need for real education reforms in our state. Certainly, what could be as much as a $5 million estimate RRPS is citing for this new evaluation program needs to be fully researched. Totaling new state mandates with those increased expenses, the district is staring down the barrel of an $11 million increase in expenses for Fiscal Year 2014. Most education researchers agree smaller class sizes allow more individualized attention to students, which translates into higher-performing students, which should be the goal of all of school districts. Meanwhile, the Legislature approved a 1 percent pay raise for teachers that will cost the district another $729,000 without providing the money to pay for the raise. But to make up $11 million in new expenses, the district will have to make cuts. At the same time, the district faces a 500 percent increase in unemployment expenses and a $1 million increase in property/liability insurance premiums.",0,0

8092,"Before you can figure out how much your benefit would be cut, you need to know when you reach full retirement age: the age at which you qualify for what the program designates as 100% of your Social Security benefit. The program is actually pretty flexible, allowing people to start getting retirement benefits as early as age 62, though at a reduced level. Bottom line: Everyone will face this decision, and have to strike the right balance between making sure they have as much income later in life as possible, and having the resources for an active retirement while they are still young enough to do enjoy it. Just as filing early cuts your benefit, every year you wait beyond full retirement age will boost your check. As you can see, the spousal benefit is also reduced by claiming early, with the maximum amount a spouse can claim on your work record being capped at 50% of your benefit at full retirement age. Here's how much it goes up each year beyond full retirement age: Source: Social Security Administration. By delaying the day you start taking your benefit, you'll get a bigger monthly payment, and by working longer, you postpone the time when you will use up your other assets. The boost is actually calculated based on the number of months past full retirement age you delay, with each month you wait worth a 0.67% increase in your monthly benefit. For millions of Americans, the cut in pay is well worth it, if it allows you to retire younger, when you're more physically fit and able to get more enjoyment from your retirement years. Consider this: The system is structured to pay, on average, about the same total amount to you whether you start taking benefits at 62, 66, or 70 -- assuming you live about as long as the average American. And since 66 -- or very close to it -- is the full retirement age for the majority of people retiring over the next decade, we'll use a full retirement age of 66 as the baseline for comparisons for the rest of this article. If you've got the assets to retire early while still being ready for old age, take your benefit as early as you can.",1,3

If the government is to succeed in its new measures to eradicate Islamic extremism, therefore, it should be encouraging people to discuss the matter openly, regardless of who might take offence. The fear of accusation, of standing aside from the crowd, of not being impeccably on the side of the received opinion, explains much of the legislation attacking free speech in this country. However misguided their opinion might be, it is a legitimate contribution to a much-needed public debate a debate that will not now occur, so fierce is the condemnation of those who deviate from the one permitted opinion. Deviate in the smallest matter from the orthodoxy, and you will be accused of homophobia and, although this is not yet a crime, it is accompanied, especially for those with any kind of public office, by real social costs. Why We Should Defend the Right to be Offensive.To people like me, educated in post-war Britain, free speech has been a firm premise of the British way of life. And we adapt by putting things in question, by asking whether this or that belief is true or binding, and in general by opening our hearts to other peoples arguments and attempting to meet them with arguments of our own. The law, we believed, would protect the heretics, the dissidents and the doubters against any punishments devised to intimidate or silence them, for the very reason that truth and argument are sacred, and must be protected from those who seek to suppress them. As John Stuart Mill expressed the point: The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it.

A Rescue Staged for the Screen.What drew me to the Sunday edition of Diario Vea wasnt just the headline Venezuela will never again be a colony of anyone and a cover photo of women soldiers in full uniform, wearing make-up and carrying bazookas on their shoulders. So far the U.S. press, unfortunately including much of the alternative media, have largely gone along with the official version of events in Colombia, a story in which a terrorist guerrilla insurgency has plagued the country with irrational kidnappings, drug dealing and massive violence which can only be defeated by the combined forces of the U.S. and its faithful sidekick, the Colombian government. In an AP story on the same page, a headline announces that Chavez [is] left on the sideline by the bold rescue, and that the Venezuelan leader#160; could do little more than phone congratulations to President Uribe, as if Chavezs role as a world leader consisted only in his work to free FARC hostages.

Then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., invoked a rule change to break a logjam over appointed federal judges who could not be confirmed. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the rule change would heighten partisan rancor and lead to more ideological judges appointed to the court. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., charged McConnell and Republicans of using gamesmanship to unfairly keep Garland off the bench during the 2016 presidential election year that ended with a nation deeply divided. Democrats have accused Republicans of stealing the seat, failing to grant a hearing to Judge Merrick Garland, appointed last year by President Barack Obama to fill the vacancy.

Dean Heller, a Republican, and Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, voted with their respective party leaders on each vote cast Thursday.

Introduced by California Congressman Bob Filner, the senior Democrat on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, the proposed Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act challenges our lawmakers and our nation to finally confront and repair the chemically induced public health and environmental wreckage that remains the most shameful and unresolved legacy of the U.S. war against Vietnam. One component of the bill, moreover, would authorize assistance to repair and rebuild substandard homes in Vietnam for covered individuals, as well as proposed funding for the long overdue clean-up of those areas in Vietnam that continue to contain high levels of dioxin, a program of critical importance to public health issues associated with on-going exposure to these deadly toxins. If you want to see the face of justice as it applies to the unfinished business surrounding the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam, give the H.R.

The Politics of Fear.The recently released staff report on Iran issued by the Republican-controlled House Intelligence Committee and the new National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on global terrorism conclude that the threats to U.S. national security are grave and increasing. These reports, which bolster arguments for a more aggressive global war on terror, represent the latest in a long series of documents dating back to the onset of the Cold War that declare that enemies pose ever-greater risks to U.S. national security. Many Democrats and anti-war activists believe that the intelligence assessment confirms their critiques of the Iraq War, but Republicans and Bush administration officials put a different spin on the report, claiming it supports the need to remain in Iraq and to step up antiterrorism efforts. In other words, if the U.S.-led war on terror manages to defeat the jihadists in Iraq, then Islamic terrorism might subside. The release of the partially declassified NIE, Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States, produced by the National Intelligence Council, added more fuel to the already fiery debate about the Iraq War. Indeed, the estimate points to a future of escalating terrorist threats: If current trends continue, threats to U.S. interests at home and abroad will become more diverse, leading to increasing attacks worldwide. Furthermore, We assess that the operational threat from self-radicalized cells will grow in importance to U.S. counterterrorism efforts, particularly abroad but also in the Homeland. Although it notes that the Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists, the estimate does not suggest that withdrawal from Iraq would reduce global terrorism. According to the report, Intelligence community managers and analysts must provide their best analytical judgments about Iranian WMD programs and not shy away from provocative conclusion",1,1

5023,"- Federal regulators offered more details on testing requirements for oil transported by rail on Thursday and warned companies against skirting the rules after a spate of explosions caused by crude train derailments in the U.S. and Canada. Testing already was broadly required to gauge the volatility of oil, one of hundreds of hazardous materials subject to federal oversight. ADVERTISEMENT The new order from the U.S. Department of Transportation builds on a Feb. 25 declaration that the industry's unsafe handling practices have made crude shipments an imminent hazard to public safety and the environment. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in Thursday's order that within the ""reasonable, recent past"" companies must have tested the flash point and boiling point of crude. ""They've weaseled out of this by saying it's your job to classify this (oil) properly and if you have an incident then the vast amount of time you must have violated the rules,"" Bierlein said. Officials also warned companies not to re-label crude as a more generic category of flammable liquid in an attempt to get around the testing. There's been intense political and public pressure to make oil trains safer since a runaway train with 72 tank cars of North Dakota oil derailed and exploded in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, near the Maine border in July. Unlike most hazardous materials that come from chemical plants or other manufacturing sources, crude oil is not refined before being loaded onto trains and its properties can vary greatly among shipments. Such tests help determine how likely the fuel is to ignite and dictates what type of rail car can be used for shipments. Oil trains also have exploded and burned in Alabama, North Dakota and New Brunswick in recent months. The action on Thursday, March 6, 2014 from the U.S. Department of Transportation builds on a Feb. 25 order that targeted oil shipments for more stringent testing.

7679,"For Christians like me, who were taught to celebrate the resurrection only for one day, this extended time offers the possibility to continue reflecting on this event and its meaning for our personal and communal lives. Although this triumphant tomorrow may mean literally the next day, perhaps due to a spiritualized, heavenly-bound Christian perspective, I often perceived that this powerful resurrection was mainly tied to a long-term future in heaven. While resurrection traditionally may lead us to reflect on and long for this celestial future, I consider Eastertide an invitation to think about the resurrection not only as an event that has long-term implications for our lives, but also immediate ones. Even though it is not the most glorious ending or the most accurate one because the story continued, I would be fine with it because I can identify with these womens terror and amazement. It may be scary to think about them, and even more to act accordingly, however we need to continue remembering that Because he lives, I can triumph tomorrow. Is it a calling to get involved with a social problem in my community and model a new way of life based on the values of Gods Reign? This means that we truly enjoy the resurrections effects in our present lives, wait for more at the final consummation of times, and in between labor to bring closer Gods Reign, as well as to do Gods will on earth as it is in heaven (Matthew 6:10). If we feel this way, we must realize that we are not the first ones to experience this fear. Eastertide continues for the next three weeks; may God help us to reflect on our crosses/hurts and the possibilities of resurrection. For the women in Marks gospel, the resurrection meant acknowledging Gods powerful deed as well as a decision to overcome their fear, and act accordingly. Since at that time I was going through a difficult situation, the sermon gave me a glimpse of hope. While I truly like the beginning of the New Year and affirm any resolutions that come with it, in reality I am much fonder of Eastertide.",0,2

Liberal pundits have been stewing for months over the question of whether Obama is too cautious to win big victories, too invested in a narrative of bipartisan unity to get his hands dirty in a real street fight. This is the thing that keeps me up nights about the Obama campaign: I cant help wondering whether he can actually get any of his agenda passed. Whats more, other elements of the classic liberal coalition (labor, for example) have been late, and sometimes lukewarm Obama supporters; the abortion rights group narals endorsement of him, even though it came near the end of the primary season, caused massive blowback within the organizations own ranks. Not only will Democrats probably have a bigger majority next year (even Republicans have pretty much given up on doing anything more than contain their losses in November), its likely to be one of the most liberal Democratic caucuses ever. But watching him in action for the past year, one thing has become more and more clear: He doesnt seem inclined to use his oratorical skill to truly shape public opinion. But one way or another, Obama needs to make the transition from inspiration to leadership. Democrats are almost certain to increase their control of both the House and Senate, which means that a President Obama would need crossover votes from only a handful of moderate Republicans to pass major legislation. So this is the state of play: If elected, Obama will be dealing with a Congress thats fundamentally on his side but cautious about taking political risks, and an electoral coalition thats hopeful but keenly sensitive to possible slights. Because thats what its going to take to build a sustainable progressive movement: a public thats firmly committed not just to change, but to specific change.

The majority of citizens at the meeting, like Gutierrez, expressed worry that allowing commercial marijuana farming in Corrales could have negative effects if restrictions arent put in place now. The councilors argued for over a half hour with citizens chiming in often bringing Councilor David Dornburg to suggest a postponement of the ordinance vote to discuss possible alternatives, such as a zoning ordinance that would prevent such farms from existing near residential lands. ADVERTISEMENT Councilor George Wright, the sponsor of the measure, cited concerns about a planned medical marijuana farm on the north end of Corrales, and the possible future effects of legalization on the village as a whole. I think time really is of the essence, Wright said, adding that the only thing standing in the way of the proposed farms construction is a few building permits. If passed, the ordinance would not affect people with medical marijuana cards and a personal production license from the state or currently existing medical marijuana farms within Corrales, according to a explanatory memo to the council.

Some heated exchanges between councilors followed accusations of fear mongering and objections to objections leading Mayor Scott Kominiak to bang his gravel multiple times to bring the meeting to order.

James Reinhart, CEO and founder of the online used clothing marketplace Thredup, says he's finding that many of the site's shoppers aren't motivated just by price the way they used to be, but also because of environmental concerns. But people's style and quality expectations put pressure on retailers to keep prices the same, even though manufacturing through the recycling process can be more expensive. Hamp;M, which is offering jeans this fall made from recycled fabric, says more than 26 percent of its clothing comes from sustainable sources like organic cotton or recycled materials like leather and denim.

1661,"The notion of a transfer of San Juan-Chama Project water over on the Chama to Sipapu ski area would seem to defy geography and physics. Writing at La Jicarita, Kay Matthews explains the strangeness: How, you may ask, can San Juan/Chama water, which comes from tributaries of the Colorado River through the Azotea Tunnel into Heron Reservoir and then into the Rio Chama, be transferred to the Rio Pueblo in a different watershed? But in the sometimes zany world of New Mexico water rights management, might it make sense on paper? Its a simple enough question and the applicants seem to think the answer is just as simple: the 100 afy consumption at Sipapu will be offset by the release of San Juan/Chama water from the reservoir because both the Rio Chama and the Rio Pueblo are tributaries to the Rio Grande, ergo instead of 100 afy flowing into the Rio Grande from the Rio Pueblo it will flow from Heron Dam and the Chama River into the Rio Grande. Whether this is koshera depletion in one watershed with offsets in anotherwill depend upon the assessment of the OSE based on state water law.

Some charter-school regulators 2013 recognizing their limited authority over charter-management companies 2013 are beginning to push back, requiring schools to get more information from management firms. In Ohio, ten charter-school boards sued their management firm, White Hat Management, in 2010 after they couldnt get answers to basic questions about why their schools performance lagged and how the schools money was spent. While relationships between charter schools and management companies have started to come under scrutiny, sweeps contracts have received little attention. In 2012, state auditors tried to track the $10 million in public funding given to the school, only to conclude they were unable to determine the extent to which the $10 million of annual public funding provided to the school was actually used to benefit its students. Still, that hasnt stopped some management companies from putting up a fight.#160; Regulators in the District of Columbia are seeking more legal authority over management firms after two recent scandals.

At that time however, the Southern states did not have enough electoral votes to carry Cleveland into office. There were several reasons why this pathetic candidate has been given the Oval Office: There was, of course rampant skullduggery on the part of Debbie Wassermann Schultz and the Democratic National Committee who screwed us out of the only candidate that could have beaten Trump hands-down (Bernie Sanders, in case youve forgotten). 68, Alexander Hamilton clarified, writing that the one purpose of the Constitution is to make certain that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications.

13076,"Obama’s Challenge.by Andrew Kohut, President, Pew Research Center Special to the New York Times As Democrats gather in Denver, many may be looking at the national polls and wondering how the presidential race has tightened so much given that voters are still concerned about the state of the nation and give low ratings to President Bush and the Republican Party. The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press poll last week found Barack Obamas lead over his Republican rival withering. In contrast, Obama made little progress in increasing his support among core Democrats since June. And the poll found that the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate was still getting only modest support (72%) from Hillary Clintons former supporters. Indeed, McCain is now garnering more support from Republicans and white evangelical Protestants than he had June, and steadily gained backing from white working-class voters over the last two months. An early August Pew survey found 48% of respondents saying they had heard too much about Barack Obama. During the summer, the Pew Research Centers Project for Excellence in Journalism found much more extensive media coverage of Obama than McCain. A mid-July Pew survey found 59% of voters saying they knew little or nothing about his foreign policy positions, and 49% said the same about his economic positions. Just 26% in the poll said they had heard too much about John McCain, while 38% reported that they had heard too little about the likely Republican nominee. A look at these latest trends suggests that while McCain has made some gains over the last two months, perceptions of Obama have stalled. In August, 83% of Democrats favored him compared with 87% of Republicans who back McCain. Most important, McCain has been more successful in rallying Republicans to his side than Obama has been in unifying the Democratic Party.",0,0

5424,"The stimulus involves the bank purchasing 60 billion euros ($72 billion) of bonds a month in the markets in order to keep interest rates low and get inflation up to its goal of just under 2 percent, a level considered healthy for the eurozone economy. Strong economic growth in the eurozone has ratcheted up expectations that the bank, which sets interest rates for the 19 countries that use the euro, will soon start to phase out its bond-buying program. President Mario Draghi said Thursday that the bank is reassessing the bond-buying program, which is credited with boosting growth by reducing borrowing rates, and could announce changes as early as next month. He has been reluctant to spell out the timing and pace of the phase-out of the bond purchases for fear of sending the euro and market interest rates higher ahead of the fact. On the currency, Draghi said the recent exchange rate volatility, which has seen the euro rally about 15 percent this year to breach the $1.20 mark for the first time in two and a half years, requires monitoring and is a source of uncertainty. At a press conference after the banks 25-member governing council decided to leave its interest rates and bond-buying program unchanged, Draghi said the ECB will soon decide on the calibration of its policy instruments beyond 2017. ADVERTISEMENT Schmieding predicted the ECB would announce on Oct. 26 that it will cut the bond purchases from 60 billion euros to 45 billion euros starting in January, and make further reductions every three months if growth and inflation stay on track.

The new CalSTRS demographic report#160;issued last week, done in part to show differences among employer types, covers a period beginning in fiscal 1997-98 as a stock-market boom yielded big earnings for pension fund investments. The CalSTRS funding overhaul approved earlier this year actually reduced teachers relative share of their pension costs. Modest-seeming CalSTRS pension estimate lacks key context.The California Teachers Association and the California Federation of Teachers do a good job of promoting the narrative that state teacher pensions are very modest at best. But what was adopted in 2012 still committed public employees to paying a great share of pension costs. It includes anyone who ever became eligible for a CalSTRS pension $48,904 is the average for all teachers in the retirement system. A new look at how CalSTRS members changed during the last 15 years shows the average teacher working fewer years, retiring at an older age and collecting a pension that grew faster than pay or inflation. The provision in his 2014-15 budget shoring up funding for the California State Teachers Retirement System requires that taxpayers foot 90 percent of the [new additional contributions to CalSTRS] and teachers just 10 percent. The theory was that if employees had to share equally in the huge cost of their pensions, theyd be more amenable to plans to reduce them going forward so as to increase their take-home pay. A brief pension fund surplus helped prompt legislation in the late 1990s and 2000 that increased pension benefits in several ways, while also cutting the annual employer and employee contributions to the pension fund.

400,"Carrell Key parts of the task forces report based on more than 100 listening sessions around the country would replace the CBFs 64-member Coordinating Council with three smaller councils; offer more funding flexibility to both churches and the CBFs state and regional affiliates; and, for the first time, provide a process for congregations to intentionally identify with the CBF. We need a leadership team that can focus on the identity, image, marketing and funding of the CBF as a whole and not one that gets too overwhelmed by all the diverse ministries, he said. The mission and ministries councils are critical to our restructuring because these are the ones whose areas of focus really get at the heart of what Fellowship Baptists care about most, said Stephen Cook, a member of the task force and pastor of Second Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn. Cook, a former pastor of First Baptist Church in Danville, Va., and former moderator-elect of the CBF of Virginia, said the two councils will be where the CBFs best and brightest mission and ministry-minded folks come together to cast vision, set strategic priorities and point us all to the places in CBFs life where we can see our life together flourish. CBF proposals clarify identity, say Mid-Atlantic leaders.RICHMOND, Va. A proposed task force report to be considered by the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship this summer will clarify the groups identity and more effectively mobilize grassroots involvement, agree CBF leaders in the Mid-Atlantic, who said the changes will significantly expand support for the 20-year-old network of churches. At its February meeting, the Coordinating Council raised several questions about proposed changes in the way the CBF collects money from churches. Individual churches could support the plan adopted by their state CBF or adjust their giving to better reflect individual spending priorities. Under the plan, the 64-member Coordinating Council would be replaced with a smaller Governing Council of 16 members which would focus narrowly on governance and work closely with the CBF national staff. The plan would allow state and regional CBF organizations to determine percentages of funds to be divided among national and state missions and ministries and various",0,2

While her official platform is Habitat for Humanity, shes now burning up with another cause: I want, no matter what happens, for Miss World to have more of a name here, she said. I dont think that Miss World is a pageant, she went on. This is quite a very tough one to take, Morley said of Miss Kenyas video about female genital mutilation, a topic championed by four contestants.

Let alone that the global pageant which is considered more prestigious than Miss Universe is happening right now, on the Maryland fringe of the nations capital, with a crowning Sunday at the new MGM National Harbor casino. If you come from a pageant-crazy country like the Philippines, youre a big deal. Morley decided to bring the pageant to Washington because, she said, the city exemplified something more achievable for a woman to be able to realize more for herself.

7590,"Continue Reading Below Alaska heavily relies on oil revenue to fund the cost of state government, but the fall in prices has contributed to an estimated 80 percent decline in the state's share of production taxes from last year. The new governor, Republican-turned-independent Bill Walker, is among those calling for a look at revenues along with budget cuts, but that could involve ideas that no one who dreams of re-election is eager to take up. Gunnar Knapp, director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska Anchorage, said lawmakers don't have to drastically cut spending this year or raise new revenue. Every year, most Alaskans receive a dividend based on the five-year average of the realized earnings of Alaska's oil wealth account, the Alaska Permanent Fund. Among those ideas are instituting a personal income or sales taxes, or tapping Alaska's oil wealth fund, which provides nearly every Alaskan with a yearly check just for living here. Many in the GOP-controlled Legislature are looking to a proposed major liquefied natural gas project as the state's next best hope for any significant new revenue. In the last few years, high oil prices helped insulate Alaska from the brunt of the recession felt acutely elsewhere. Alaska faces tough decisions, drastic budget cuts, dipping into savings as oil prices plunge.After years of being flush with oil money, Alaska now faces drastic budget cuts and having to dip into well-stocked savings to offset unprecedented deficits exacerbated by an unexpected plunge in oil prices. ""The numbers just don't allow you to cut your way out of this, not without some severe impacts on the economy,"" said David Teal, director of the Legislative Finance Division. Walker has said Alaska this year stands to pay out about $100 million more in oil and gas credits than the production tax brings in. Wielechowski said lawmakers should find other sources of funds, such as setting a minimum oil tax to better protect the state at low oil prices. That project is years away from production, if it gets built, and the state would have to invest potentially billions of dollars to reach that point",1,3

Asked what that next thing might be, The Atrisco Kid said hed leave that to his promoter, Golden Boy, and his manager and father, Fidel Sr. Atlas and Tessitore saw the Albuquerque southpaw as in control throughout, save for a knockdown suffered in the waning seconds of the fourth round. By the end, according to ESPN statistics, Cano threw 572 punches but landed just 78, or 14 percent. Yes, that guy who in the past has struggled to harness his warrior instinct and engaged in brawls when something more artistic was called for. Maldonados being the man right now, Atlas said in the third round. In May, when the Cano fight was announced, Maldonado Sr. said there was already something big in the works should Fidel Jr. win on Saturday. When he beats this guy and he does it impressively, they already have something lined up, Maldonado Sr. said at the time.

1683,"ADVERTISEMENT One of my daughters went and bought a W flag and about a week ago went to the cemetery and put it there with them, said Terry Ann Arriaga, whose father died the year the Cubs came within five outs of reaching the World Series back in 2003 and whose mother passed during spring training this year. But the Cubs reached the NLCS last season, too, and raced to the best record in the majors this season, giving fans a fresh jolt of hope and, for Thompson and others, a very real way to ease the grief. In a city where fans have been known to scatter ashes of the dearly departed at Wrigley Field, families of those who could no longer wait till next season are planting Cubs pennants and flags at the graves of loved ones or sending them off to the great beyond with Cubs hats and jerseys in their caskets. As the Cubs try to reach the World Series for the first time since 1945 and win it for the first time since 1908, Chicago is awash in Cubbie blue and red. Kenneth Muellers family honored his wishes by burying him in a Cubs T-shirt and his death notice last month asked those attending the wake to try to wear Cubs attire. Such a connection might help explain a suspicion among Cubs Nation that the recently departed are somehow watching the playoffs and maybe doing more. When the Cubs got to the playoffs my mom would go shopping to get a wardrobe (because) she was hoping to go, but my dad would always say nothing matters until the World Series, he said. Shed be saying, I sat here (at Wrigley) for 30 years and nobody would even come to the game with me.
